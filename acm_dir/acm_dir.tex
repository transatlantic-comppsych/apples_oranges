\hypertarget{introduction}{%
\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

ACM's consolidated article template, introduced in 2017, provides a
consistent \LaTeX~style for use across ACM publications, and
incorporates accessibility and metadata-extraction functionality
necessary for future Digital Library endeavors. Numerous ACM and
SIG-specific \LaTeX~templates have been examined, and their unique
features incorporated into this single new template.

If you are new to publishing with ACM, this document is a valuable guide
to the process of preparing your work for publication. If you have
published with ACM before, this document provides insight and
instruction into more recent changes to the article template.

The ``\texttt{acmart}'' document class can be used to prepare articles
for any ACM publication --- conference or journal, and for any stage of
publication, from review to final ``camera-ready'' copy, to the author's
own version, with \emph{very} few changes to the source.

\hypertarget{template-overview}{%
\section{Template Overview}\label{template-overview}}

As noted in the introduction, the ``\texttt{acmart}'' document class can
be used to prepare many different kinds of documentation --- a
double-blind initial submission of a full-length technical paper, a
two-page SIGGRAPH Emerging Technologies abstract, a ``camera-ready''
journal article, a SIGCHI Extended Abstract, and more --- all by
selecting the appropriate \emph{template style} and \emph{template
parameters}.

This document will explain the major features of the document class. For
further information, the \emph{\LaTeX~User's Guide} is available from
\url{https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template}.

\hypertarget{template-styles}{%
\subsection{Template Styles}\label{template-styles}}

The primary parameter given to the ``\texttt{acmart}'' document class is
the \emph{template style} which corresponds to the kind of publication
or SIG publishing the work. This parameter is enclosed in square
brackets and is a part of the ``\texttt{documentclass}'' command:

\begin{verbatim}
  \documentclass[STYLE]{acmart}
\end{verbatim}

Journals use one of three template styles. All but three ACM journals
use the ``\texttt{acmsmall}'' template style:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{acmsmall}: The default journal template style.
\item
  \texttt{acmlarge}: Used by JOCCH and TAP.
\item
  \texttt{acmtog}: Used by TOG.
\end{itemize}

The majority of conference proceedings documentation will use the
``\texttt{cmconf}'' template style.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{acmconf}: The default proceedings template style.
\item
  \texttt{sigchi}: Used for SIGCHI conference articles.
\item
  \texttt{sigchi-a}: Used for SIGCHI ``Extended Abstract'' articles.
\item
  \texttt{sigplan}: Used for SIGPLAN conference articles.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{template-parameters}{%
\subsection{Template Parameters}\label{template-parameters}}

In addition to specifying the \emph{template style} to be used in
formatting your work, there are a number of \emph{template parameters}
which modify some part of the applied template style. A complete list of
these parameters can be found in the \emph{\LaTeX~User's Guide.}

Frequently-used parameters, or combinations of parameters, include:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{anonymous,review}: Suitable for a ``double-blind'' conference
  submission. Anonymizes the work and includes line numbers. Use with
  the \texttt{\textbackslash{}acmSubmissionID} command to print the
  submission's unique ID on each page of the work.
\item
  \texttt{authorversion}: Produces a version of the work suitable for
  posting by the author.
\item
  \texttt{screen}: Produces colored hyperlinks.
\end{itemize}

This document uses the following string as the first command in the
source file:

\begin{verbatim}
  \documentclass[manuscript,screen,review]{acmart}
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{modifications}{%
\section{Modifications}\label{modifications}}

Modifying the template --- including but not limited to: adjusting
margins, typeface sizes, line spacing, paragraph and list definitions,
and the use of the \texttt{\textbackslash{}vspace} command to manually
adjust the vertical spacing between elements of your work --- is not
allowed.

\textbf{Your document will be returned to you for revision if
modifications are discovered.}

\hypertarget{typefaces}{%
\section{Typefaces}\label{typefaces}}

The ``\texttt{acmart}'' document class requires the use of the
``Libertine'' typeface family. Your \TeX~installation should include
this set of packages. Please do not substitute other typefaces. The
``\texttt{lmodern}'' and ``\texttt{ltimes}'' packages should not be
used, as they will override the built-in typeface families.

\hypertarget{title-information}{%
\section{Title Information}\label{title-information}}

The title of your work should use capital letters appropriately -
\url{https://capitalizemytitle.com/} has useful rules for
capitalization. Use the ``\texttt{title}'' command to define the title
of your work. If your work has a subtitle, define it with the
``\texttt{subtitle}'' command. Do not insert line breaks in your title.

If your title is lengthy, you must define a short version to be used in
the page headers, to prevent overlapping text. The ``\texttt{title}''
command has a ``short title'' parameter:

\begin{verbatim}
  \title[short title]{full title}
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{authors-and-affiliations}{%
\section{Authors and Affiliations}\label{authors-and-affiliations}}

Each author must be defined separately for accurate metadata
identification. As an exception, multiple authors may share one
affiliation. Authors' names should not be abbreviated; use full first
names wherever possible. Include authors' e-mail addresses whenever
possible.

Grouping authors' names or e-mail addresses, or providing an ``e-mail
alias,'' as shown below, is not acceptable:

\begin{verbatim}
  \author{Brooke Aster, David Mehldau}
  \email{dave,judy,steve@university.edu}
  \email{firstname.lastname@phillips.org}
\end{verbatim}

The \texttt{authornote} and \texttt{authornotemark} commands allow a
note to apply to multiple authors --- for example, if the first two
authors of an article contributed equally to the work.

If your author list is lengthy, you must define a shortened version of
the list of authors to be used in the page headers, to prevent
overlapping text. The following command should be placed just after the
last \texttt{\textbackslash{}author\{\}} definition:

\begin{verbatim}
  \renewcommand{\shortauthors}{McCartney, et al.}
\end{verbatim}

Omitting this command will force the use of a concatenated list of all
of the authors' names, which may result in overlapping text in the page
headers.

The article template's documentation, available at
\url{https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template}, has a
complete explanation of these commands and tips for their effective use.

Note that authors' addresses are mandatory for journal articles.

\hypertarget{rights-information}{%
\section{Rights Information}\label{rights-information}}

Authors of any work published by ACM will need to complete a rights
form. Depending on the kind of work, and the rights management choice
made by the author, this may be copyright transfer, permission, license,
or an OA (open access) agreement.

Regardless of the rights management choice, the author will receive a
copy of the completed rights form once it has been submitted. This form
contains \LaTeX~commands that must be copied into the source document.
When the document source is compiled, these commands and their
parameters add formatted text to several areas of the final document:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  the ``ACM Reference Format'' text on the first page.
\item
  the ``rights management'' text on the first page.
\item
  the conference information in the page header(s).
\end{itemize}

Rights information is unique to the work; if you are preparing several
works for an event, make sure to use the correct set of commands with
each of the works.

The ACM Reference Format text is required for all articles over one page
in length, and is optional for one-page articles (abstracts).

\hypertarget{ccs-concepts-and-user-defined-keywords}{%
\section{CCS Concepts and User-Defined
Keywords}\label{ccs-concepts-and-user-defined-keywords}}

Two elements of the ``acmart'' document class provide powerful taxonomic
tools for you to help readers find your work in an online search.

The ACM Computing Classification System ---
\url{https://www.acm.org/publications/class-2012} --- is a set of
classifiers and concepts that describe the computing discipline. Authors
can select entries from this classification system, via
\url{https://dl.acm.org/ccs/ccs.cfm}, and generate the commands to be
included in the \LaTeX~source.

User-defined keywords are a comma-separated list of words and phrases of
the authors' choosing, providing a more flexible way of describing the
research being presented.

CCS concepts and user-defined keywords are required for for all articles
over two pages in length, and are optional for one- and two-page
articles (or abstracts).

\hypertarget{sectioning-commands}{%
\section{Sectioning Commands}\label{sectioning-commands}}

Your work should use standard \LaTeX~sectioning commands:
\texttt{section}, \texttt{subsection}, \texttt{subsubsection}, and
\texttt{paragraph}. They should be numbered; do not remove the numbering
from the commands.

Simulating a sectioning command by setting the first word or words of a
paragraph in boldface or italicized text is \textbf{not allowed.}

\hypertarget{tables}{%
\section{Tables}\label{tables}}

The ``\texttt{acmart}'' document class includes the
``\texttt{booktabs}'' package --- \url{https://ctan.org/pkg/booktabs}
--- for preparing high-quality tables.

Table captions are placed \emph{above} the table.

Because tables cannot be split across pages, the best placement for them
is typically the top of the page nearest their initial cite. To ensure
this proper ``floating'' placement of tables, use the environment
\textbf{table} to enclose the table's contents and the table caption.
The contents of the table itself must go in the \textbf{tabular}
environment, to be aligned properly in rows and columns, with the
desired horizontal and vertical rules. Again, detailed instructions on
\textbf{tabular} material are found in the \emph{\LaTeX~User's Guide}.

Immediately following this sentence is the point at which
Table~\ref{tbl-freq} is included in the input file; compare the
placement of the table here with the table in the printed output of this
document.

\hypertarget{tbl-freq}{}
\begin{longtable}[]{@{}ccl@{}}
\caption{\label{tbl-freq}Frequency of Special Characters}\tabularnewline
\toprule\noalign{}
Non-English or Math & Frequency & Comments \\
\midrule\noalign{}
\endfirsthead
\toprule\noalign{}
Non-English or Math & Frequency & Comments \\
\midrule\noalign{}
\endhead
\bottomrule\noalign{}
\endlastfoot
Ø & 1 in 1,000 & For Swedish names \\
\(\pi\) & 1 in 5 & Common in math \\
\$ & 4 in 5 & Used in business \\
\(\Psi^2_1\) & 1 in 40,000 & Unexplained usage \\
\end{longtable}

To set a wider table, which takes up the whole width of the page's live
area, use the environment \textbf{table*} to enclose the table's
contents and the table caption. As with a single-column table, this wide
table will ``float'' to a location deemed more desirable. Immediately
following this sentence is the point at which Table~\ref{tbl-commands}
is included in the input file; again, it is instructive to compare the
placement of the table here with the table in the printed output of this
document.

\hypertarget{tbl-commands}{}
\begin{longtable}[]{@{}ccl@{}}
\caption{\label{tbl-commands}Some Typical Commands}\tabularnewline
\toprule\noalign{}
Command & A Number & Comments \\
\midrule\noalign{}
\endfirsthead
\toprule\noalign{}
Command & A Number & Comments \\
\midrule\noalign{}
\endhead
\bottomrule\noalign{}
\endlastfoot
\texttt{\textbackslash{}author} & 100 & Author \\
\texttt{\textbackslash{}table} & 300 & For tables \\
\texttt{\textbackslash{}table*} & 400 & For wider tables \\
\end{longtable}

Always use midrule to separate table header rows from data rows, and use
it only for this purpose. This enables assistive technologies to
recognise table headers and support their users in navigating tables
more easily.

\hypertarget{math-equations}{%
\section{Math Equations}\label{math-equations}}

You may want to display math equations in three distinct styles: inline,
numbered or non-numbered display. Each of the three are discussed in the
next sections.

\hypertarget{inline-in-text-equations}{%
\subsection{Inline (In-text) Equations}\label{inline-in-text-equations}}

A formula that appears in the running text is called an inline or
in-text formula. It is produced by the \textbf{math} environment, which
can be invoked with the usual
\texttt{\textbackslash{}begin,\ ...\ \textbackslash{}end} construction
or with the short form
\texttt{\textbackslash{}\$\ ...\ \textbackslash{}\$}. You can use any of
the symbols and structures, from \(\alpha\) to \(\omega\), available in
\LaTeX\citep{Lamport:LaTeX}; this section will simply show a few
examples of in-text equations in context. Notice how this equation:
\(\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}x=0\), set here in in-line math style, looks
slightly different when set in display style. (See next section).

\hypertarget{display-equations}{%
\subsection{Display Equations}\label{display-equations}}

A numbered display equation---one set off by vertical space from the
text and centered horizontally---is produced by the \textbf{equation}
environment. An unnumbered display equation is produced by the
\textbf{displaymath} environment.

Again, in either environment, you can use any of the symbols and
structures available in \LaTeX@; this section will just give a couple of
examples of display equations in context. First, consider
Equation~\ref{eq-oneequation}, shown as an inline equation above:

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq-oneequation}{}{
\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}x=0
}\label{eq-oneequation}\end{equation}

Notice how it is formatted somewhat differently in the
\textbf{displaymath} environment. Now, we'll enter an unnumbered
equation:

\[\sum_{i=0}^{\infty} x + 1\]

and follow it with Equation~\ref{eq-anotherequation}, another numbered
equation:

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq-anotherequation}{}{
\sum_{i=0}^{\infty}x_i=\int_{0}^{\pi+2} f
}\label{eq-anotherequation}\end{equation}

just to demonstrate \LaTeX's able handling of numbering.

\hypertarget{figures}{%
\section{Figures}\label{figures}}

The ``\texttt{figure}'' environment should be used for figures. One or
more images can be placed within a figure. If your figure contains
third-party material, you must clearly identify it as such, as shown in
the example below.

\begin{figure}
{\centering \includegraphics{sample-franklin.png}}
\caption{1907 Franklin Model D roadster. Photograph by Harris \& Ewing,
Inc.~{[}Public domain{]}, via Wikimedia Commons.
(\url{https://goo.gl/VLCRBB}).}
\Description{A woman and a girl in white dresses sit in an open car.}
\end{figure}

Your figures should contain a caption which describes the figure to the
reader.

Figure captions are placed \emph{below} the figure.

Every figure should also have a figure description unless it is purely
decorative. These descriptions convey what's in the image to someone who
cannot see it. They are also used by search engine crawlers for indexing
images, and when images cannot be loaded.

A figure description must be unformatted plain text less than 2000
characters long (including spaces). \textbf{Figure descriptions should
not repeat the figure caption -- their purpose is to capture important
information that is not already provided in the caption or the main text
of the paper.} For figures that convey important and complex new
information, a short text description may not be adequate. More complex
alternative descriptions can be placed in an appendix and referenced in
a short figure description. For example, provide a data table capturing
the information in a bar chart, or a structured list representing a
graph. For additional information regarding how best to write figure
descriptions and why doing this is so important, please see
\url{https://www.acm.org/publications/taps/describing-figures/}.

\hypertarget{the-teaser-figure}{%
\subsection{The ``Teaser Figure''}\label{the-teaser-figure}}

A ``teaser figure'' is an image, or set of images in one figure, that
are placed after all author and affiliation information, and before the
body of the article, spanning the page. If you wish to have such a
figure in your article, place the command immediately before the
\texttt{\textbackslash{}maketitle} command:

\begin{verbatim}
  \begin{teaserfigure}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{sampleteaser}
    \caption{figure caption}
    \Description{figure description}
  \end{teaserfigure}
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{citations-and-bibliographies}{%
\section{Citations and
Bibliographies}\label{citations-and-bibliographies}}

The use of \BibTeX~for the preparation and formatting of one's
references is strongly recommended. Authors' names should be complete
--- use full first names (``Donald E. Knuth'') not initials (``D. E.
Knuth'') --- and the salient identifying features of a reference should
be included: title, year, volume, number, pages, article DOI, etc.

The bibliography is included in your source document with these two
commands, placed just before the \verb|\end{document}| command:

\begin{verbatim}
  \bibliographystyle{ACM-Reference-Format}
  \bibliography{bibfile}
\end{verbatim}

where ``\texttt{bibfile}'' is the name, without the ``\texttt{.bib}''
suffix, of the \BibTeX~file.

Citations and references are numbered by default. A small number of ACM
publications have citations and references formatted in the ``author
year'' style; for these exceptions, please include this command in the
\textbf{preamble} (before the command
``\texttt{\textbackslash{}begin\{document\}}'') of your \LaTeX~source:

\begin{verbatim}
  \citestyle{acmauthoryear}
\end{verbatim}

Some examples. A paginated journal article \citep{Abril07}, an
enumerated journal article \citep{Cohen07}, a reference to an entire
issue \citep{JCohen96}, a monograph (whole book) \citep{Kosiur01}, a
monograph/whole book in a series (see 2a in spec. document)
\citep{Harel79}, a divisible-book such as an anthology or compilation
\citep{Editor00} followed by the same example, however we only output
the series if the volume number is given \citep{Editor00a} (so
Editor00a's series should NOT be present since it has no vol.~no.), a
chapter in a divisible book \citep{Spector90}, a chapter in a divisible
book in a series \citep{Douglass98}, a multi-volume work as book
\citep{Knuth97}, a couple of articles in a proceedings (of a conference,
symposium, workshop for example) (paginated proceedings article)
\citep[\citet{Hagerup1993}]{Andler79}, a proceedings article with all
possible elements \citep{Smith10}, an example of an enumerated
proceedings article \citep{VanGundy07}, an informally published work
\citep{Harel78}, a couple of preprints
\citep[\citet{AnzarootPBM14}]{Bornmann2019}, a doctoral dissertation
\citep{Clarkson85}, a master's thesis: \citep{anisi03}, an online
document / world wide web resource \citep[\citet{Ablamowicz07},
\citet{Poker06}]{Thornburg01}, a video game (Case 1) \citep{Obama08} and
(Case 2)\citep{Novak03} and \citep{Lee05} and (Case 3) a patent
\citep{JoeScientist001}, work accepted for publication \citep{rous08},
`YYYYb'-test for prolific author \citep{SaeediMEJ10} and
\citep{SaeediJETC10}. Other cites might contain `duplicate' DOI and URLs
(some SIAM articles) \citep{Kirschmer-2010-AEI-1958016-1958018}. Boris /
Barbara Beeton: multi-volume works as books \citep{MR781536} and
\citep{MR781537}. A couple of citations with DOIs:
\citep[\citet{Kirschmer-2010-AEI-1958016-1958018}]{2004-ITE-1009386-1010128}.
Online citations: \citep[\citet{Thornburg01},

\citep{UMassCitations}.

\hypertarget{acknowledgments}{%
\section{Acknowledgments}\label{acknowledgments}}

Identification of funding sources and other support, and thanks to
individuals and groups that assisted in the research and the preparation
of the work should be included in an acknowledgment section, which is
placed just before the reference section in your document.

This section has a special environment:

\begin{verbatim}
  \begin{acks}
  ...
  \end{acks}
\end{verbatim}

so that the information contained therein can be more easily collected
during the article metadata extraction phase, and to ensure consistency
in the spelling of the section heading.

Authors should not prepare this section as a numbered or unnumbered
\texttt{\textbackslash{}section}; please the
``\texttt{\textbackslash{}acks}'' environment.

\hypertarget{appendices}{%
\section{Appendices}\label{appendices}}

If your work needs an appendix, add it before the
``\texttt{\textbackslash{}end\{document\}}'' command at the conclusion
of your source document.

Start the appendix with the ``\texttt{appendix}'' command:

\begin{verbatim}
  \appendix
\end{verbatim}

and note that in the appendix, sections are lettered, not numbered. This
document has two appendices, demonstrating the section and subsection
identification method.

\hypertarget{multi-language-papers}{%
\section{Multi-language papers}\label{multi-language-papers}}

Papers may be written in languages other than English or include titles,
subtitles, keywords and abstracts in different languages (as a rule, a
paper in a language other than English should include an English title
and an English abstract). Use \texttt{language=...} for every language
used in the paper. The last language indicated is the main language of
the paper. For example, a French paper with additional titles and
abstracts in English and German may start with the following command

\begin{verbatim}
  \documentclass[sigconf, language=english, language=german,
                 language=french]{acmart}
\end{verbatim}

The title, subtitle, keywords and abstract will be typeset in the main
language of the paper. The commands
\texttt{\textbackslash{}translatedXXX}, \texttt{XXX} being
\texttt{title}, \texttt{subtitle} and \texttt{keywords}, can be used to
set these elements in the other languages. The environment
\texttt{translatedabstract} is used to set the translation of the
abstract. These commands and environment have a mandatory first
argument: the language of the second argument. See
\texttt{sample-sigconf-i13n.tex} file for examples of their usage.

\hypertarget{sigchi-extended-abstracts}{%
\section{SIGCHI Extended Abstracts}\label{sigchi-extended-abstracts}}

The ``\texttt{sigchi-a}'' template style (available only in \LaTeX~and
not in Word) produces a landscape-orientation formatted article, with a
wide left margin. Three environments are available for use with the
``\texttt{sigchi-a}'' template style, and produce formatted output in
the margin:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{\texttt{sidebar}}: Place formatted text in the margin.
\item
  \textbf{\texttt{marginfigure}}: Place a figure in the margin.
\item
  \textbf{\texttt{margintable}}: Place a table in the margin.
\end{itemize}

\begin{acks}
To Robert, for the bagels and explaining CMYK and color spaces.
\end{acks}
