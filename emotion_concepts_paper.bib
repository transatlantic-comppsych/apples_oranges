  abstract = {Background: The global shortage of mental health workers has prompted the utilization of technological advancements, such as chatbots, to meet the needs of people with mental health conditions. Chatbots are systems that are able to converse and interact with human users using spoken, written, and visual language. While numerous studies have assessed the effectiveness and safety of using chatbots in mental health, no reviews have pooled the results of those studies. Objective: This study aimed to assess the effectiveness and safety of using chatbots to improve mental health through summarizing and pooling the results of previous studies. Methods: A systematic review was carried out to achieve this objective. The search sources were 7 bibliographic databases (eg, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO), the search engine ``Google Scholar,'' and backward and forward reference list checking of the included studies and relevant reviews. Two reviewers independently selected the studies, extracted data from the included studies, and assessed the risk of bias. Data extracted from studies were synthesized using narrative and statistical methods, as appropriate. Results: Of 1048 citations retrieved, we identified 12 studies examining the effect of using chatbots on 8 outcomes. Weak evidence demonstrated that chatbots were effective in improving depression, distress, stress, and acrophobia. In contrast, according to similar evidence, there was no statistically significant effect of using chatbots on subjective psychological wellbeing. Results were conflicting regarding the effect of chatbots on the severity of anxiety and positive and negative affect. Only two studies assessed the safety of chatbots and concluded that they are safe in mental health, as no adverse events or harms were reported. Conclusions: Chatbots have the potential to improve mental health. However, the evidence in this review was not sufficient to definitely conclude this due to lack of evidence that their effect is clinically important, a lack of studies assessing each outcome, high risk of bias in those studies, and conflicting results for some outcomes. Further studies are required to draw solid conclusions about the effectiveness and safety of chatbots.

We found 269 samples in 119 studies for meta-analyses of Pearson rs between ratings by parents, teachers, mental health workers, observers, peers, and the subjects themselves. The mean rs between all types of informants were statistically significant. The mean rs were .60 between similar informants (e.g., pairs of parents), .28 between different types of informants (e.g., parent/teacher), and .22 between subjects and other informants. Correlations were significantly higher for 6- to 11-year-olds than for adolescents, and for undercontrolled versus overcontrolled problems, although these differences were not large. The modest correlations between informants indicate that child and adolescent problems are not effectively captured by present-versus-absent judgments of problems. Instead, the variations between reports by different informants argue for assessment in terms of multiple axes designed to reflect the perceived variations in child and adolescent functioning.

  abstract = {Computational Psychiatry aims to describe the relationship between the brain's neurobiology, its environment and mental symptoms in computational terms. In so doing, it may improve psychiatric classification and the diagnosis and treatment of mental illness. It can unite many levels of description in a mechanistic and rigorous fashion, while avoiding biological reductionism and artificial categorisation. We describe how computational models of cognition can infer the current state of the environment and weigh up future actions, and how these models provide new perspectives on two example disorders, depression and schizophrenia. Reinforcement learning describes how the brain can choose and value courses of actions according to their long-term future value. Some depressive symptoms may result from aberrant valuations, which could arise from prior beliefs about the loss of agency ('helplessness'), or from an inability to inhibit the mental exploration of aversive events. Predictive coding explains how the brain might perform Bayesian inference about the state of its environment by combining sensory data with prior beliefs, each weighted according to their certainty (or precision). Several cortical abnormalities in schizophrenia might reduce precision at higher levels of the inferential hierarchy, biasing inference towards sensory data and away from prior beliefs. We discuss whether striatal hyperdopaminergia might have an adaptive function in this context, and also how reinforcement learning and incentive salience models may shed light on the disorder. Finally, we review some of Computational Psychiatry's applications to neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, and some pitfalls to avoid when applying its methods.},

We investigated the effects of diagnostic subtypes of SAD and comorbidity with mood and anxiety disorders on impairment. In addition, we used cluster analysis procedures to empirically identify subgroups of individuals with distinct patterns of impairment. Participants were 216 treatment-seeking individuals with SAD. Clinical interviews were undertaken to determine diagnoses of anxiety disorders and major depressive disorder, and a battery of self-report measures was administered to index symptoms of social anxiety, depression and extent of impairment. Results indicated that individuals with the generalized subtype of SAD had greater impairment in all three life domains compared to individuals with the nongeneralized subtype. Comorbidity with mood disorders was associated with greater impairment than SAD alone, but comorbidity with anxiety disorders was not. Four distinct impairment profiles emerged from the cluster analysis: primary work/studies impairment, primary social life impairment, both work/studies and social impairment, and impairment in all domains. Findings from this study suggest that SAD is associated with substantial impairment across multiple domains, and that individuals with SAD present diverse impairment profiles. These profiles may inform subtyping of the disorder as well as therapeutic interventions.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Major depressive disorder is characterized by reduced reward-related striatal activation and dysfunctional reward learning, putatively reflecting decreased dopaminergic signaling. The goal of this study was to test whether a pharmacological challenge designed to facilitate dopaminergic transmission can enhance striatal responses to reward and improve reward learning in depressed individuals. METHOD: In a double-blind placebo-controlled design, 46 unmedicated depressed participants and 43 healthy control participants were randomly assigned to receive either placebo or a single low dose (50 mg) of the D2/D3 receptor antagonist amisulpride, which is believed to increase dopamine signaling through presynaptic autoreceptor blockade. To investigate the effects of increased dopaminergic transmission on reward-related striatal function and behavior, a monetary incentive delay task (in conjunction with functional MRI) and a probabilistic reward learning task were administered at absorption peaks of amisulpride. RESULTS: Depressed participants selected previously rewarded stimuli less frequently than did control participants, indicating reduced reward learning, but this effect was not modulated by amisulpride. Relative to depressed participants receiving placebo (and control participants receiving amisulpride), depressed participants receiving amisulpride exhibited increased striatal activation and potentiated corticostriatal functional connectivity between the nucleus accumbens and the midcingulate cortex in response to monetary rewards. Stronger corticostriatal connectivity in response to rewards predicted better reward learning among depressed individuals receiving amisulpride as well as among control participants receiving placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Acute enhancement of dopaminergic transmission potentiated reward-related striatal activation and corticostriatal functional connectivity in depressed individuals but had no behavioral effects. Taken together, the results suggest that targeted pharmacological treatments may normalize neural correlates of reward processing in depression; despite such acute effects on neural function, behavioral modification may require more chronic exposure. This is consistent with previous reports that antidepressant effects of amisulpride in depression emerged after sustained administration.},

The approach brackets the conscious experience of emotion, lists plausible features that emotions exhibit, and argues that alternative schemes (e.g., focusing on feelings or on neurobiology as the starting point) are unpromising candidates. We conclude with the benefits of our approach: one can study emotions in animals; one can look in the brain for the implementation of specific features; and one ends up with an architecture of the mind in which emotions are fully accommodated through their relations to the rest of cognition. Our article focuses on arguing for this general approach; as such, it is an essay in the philosophy of emotion rather than in the psychology or neuroscience of emotion.},

In particular, it is important to document how the use of the DAWBA influences clinical decision-making. The present study employed the DAWBA in a consecutive series of 270 new referrals to a large public child and adolescent psychiatric service in Zurich, Switzerland. ICD-10 based diagnoses were obtained from clinicians for all patients and reliability of DAWBA expert raters was calculated. The DAWBA diagnoses were randomly disclosed (n~=~144) or not disclosed (n~=~126) before clinical decision-making. The reliability of DAWBA expert diagnoses was very satisfactory and the agreement under the disclosed versus the non-disclosed condition amounted to 77 versus 68~\% for internalizing disorders and to 63 versus 71~\% for externalizing disorders. The increment in agreement due to disclosure of the DAWBA diagnosis was significant for internalizing disorders. Access to DAWBA information was more likely to prompt clinicians to add an extra diagnosis. Professional background and degree of clinical experience did not affect diagnostic agreement. Overall, diagnostic agreements between DAWBA expert diagnoses and clinical diagnoses were in the fair to moderate range and comparable to previous studies with other structured diagnostic interviews. The inclusion of the DAWBA into the clinical assessment process had an impact on diagnostic decision-making regarding internalizing disorders but not regarding externalizing disorders.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: The relationship between ethnicity and adolescent mental health was investigated using cross-sectional data from the nationally representative UK Millennium Cohort Study. METHODS: Parental Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire reports identified mental health problems in 10,357 young people aged 14 (n\,=\,2042 from ethnic minority backgrounds: Mixed n\,=\,492, Indian n\,=\,275, Pakistani n\,=\,496, Bangladeshi n\,=\,221, Black Caribbean n\,=\,102, Black African n\,=\,187, Other Ethnic Group n\,=\,269). Univariable logistic regression models investigated associations between each factor and outcome; a bivariable model investigated whether household income explained differences by ethnicity, and a multivariable model additionally adjusted for factors of social support (self-assessed support, parental relationship), participation (socialising, organised activities, religious attendance), and adversity (bullying, victimisation, substance use). Results were stratified by sex as evidence of a sex/ethnicity interaction was found (P\,=\,0.0002). RESULTS: There were lower unadjusted odds for mental health problems in boys from Black African (OR 0.15, 95\% CI 0.04-0.61) and Indian backgrounds (OR 0.42, 95\% CI 0.21-0.86) compared to White peers. After adjustment for income, odds were lower in boys from Black African (OR 0.10, 95\% CI 0.02-0.38), Indian (OR 0.40, 95\% CI 0.21-0.77), and Pakistani (OR 0.49, 95\% CI 0.27-0.89) backgrounds, and girls from Bangladeshi (OR 0.18, 95\% CI 0.05-0.65) and Pakistani (OR 0.63, 95\% CI 0.41-0.99) backgrounds. After further adjustment for social support, participation, and adversity factors, only boys from a Black African background had lower odds (OR 0.16, 95\% CI 0.03-0.71) of mental health problems. CONCLUSIONS: Household income confounded lower prevalence of mental health problems in some young people from Pakistani and Bangladeshi backgrounds; findings suggest ethnic differences are partly but not fully accounted for by income, social support, participation, and adversity. Addressing income inequalities and socially focused interventions may protect against mental health problems irrespective of ethnicity.},

We exploit large-scale, longitudinal, and representative surveys for 12 countries over the period from March to December 2020, and we complement the analysis with experimental data. We find that trust in scientists is the key driving force behind individual support for and compliance with NPIs and for favorable attitudes toward vaccination. The effect of trust in government is more ambiguous and tends to diminish support for and compliance with NPIs in countries where the recommendations from scientists and the government were not aligned. Trust in others also has seemingly paradoxical effects: in countries where social trust is high, the support for NPIs is low due to higher expectations that others will voluntary social distance. Our individual-level longitudinal data also allows us to evaluate the effects of within-person changes in trust over the pandemic: we show that trust levels and, in particular, trust in scientists have changed dramatically for individuals and within countries, with important subsequent effects on compliant behavior and support for NPIs. Such findings point out the challenging but critical need to maintain trust in scientists during a lasting pandemic that strains citizens and governments.},

When this ratio reaches a point where social value and social burden are approaching equivalence, the individual is in danger of exclusion from social contexts that, over the course of evolution, have been critical to fitness. Many features of depressed states can be understood in relation to mechanisms that reduce social risk in such circumstances, including (a) hyper-sensitivity to signals of social threat from others, (b) sending signals to others that reduce social risks, and (c) inhibiting risk-seeking (e.g., confident, acquisitive) behaviors. These features are discussed in terms of psychosocial and neurobiological research on depressive phenomena.},

This paper describes the rationale, methods and the plan for the analysis of the project. A total of 22,000 individuals representative of the non-institutionalized population aged 18 and over from Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain are being interviewed in their homes. Trained interviewers use a computer-assisted personal interview (CAPI) including the most recent version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI, 2000), a well-established epidemiological survey for assessing mental disorders. This is the first international study using the standardized up-to-date methodology for epidemiological assessment. Sizeable differences in prevalence, impact and level of need that is met by the health services are expected. The analysis of these differences should facilitate the monitoring of ongoing mental health reform initiatives in Europe and provide new research hypotheses.},

  abstract = {Great advances have been made during the last 20 years in the development of structured and semi-structured interviews for use with psychiatric patients. However, in the field of child and adolescent psychiatry there have been weaknesses in the specification and definition of both symptoms and the psychosocial impairments resulting from psychiatric disorder. Furthermore, most of the available interviews for use with children have been tied to a single diagnostic system (DSM-III, DSM-III-R, or ICD-9). This has meant that symptom coverage has been limited and nosological comparisons have been inhibited. The Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Assessment (CAPA) represents an attempt to remedy some of these shortcomings. This paper outlines the principles adopted in the CAPA to improve the standardization, reliability and meaningfulness of symptom and diagnostic ratings. The CAPA is an interviewer-based diagnostic interview with versions for use with children and their parents, focused on symptoms occurring during the preceding 3 month period, adapted for assessments in both clinical and epidemiological research.},

METHOD: The interview glossary that provides detailed operational definitions of symptoms and severity ratings is described, and psychometric data and further developments of the interview are presented. RESULTS: Across 5,962 parent-child interviews, the core sections of the CAPA (psychiatric symptoms, functional impairment, demographics, family structure and functioning) took on average 59 minutes for children and 66 minutes for parents. Test-retest reliability for diagnoses ranged from kappa = 0.55 for conduct disorder (CD) to kappa = 1.0 for substance abuse/dependence. Validity as judged by 10 different criteria was good. Developments of the CAPA include a shorter "gateway" version using core symptoms as screen items, a Spanish version, and versions for twin studies, use with young adults (YAPA), and preschool-age children (PAPA). CONCLUSIONS: There is a place in both research and clinical settings for a rigorously operationalized interview (such as the CAPA) that focuses on ensuring that respondents understand what is being asked and on clearly defining levels of symptom severity and functional impairment.},

Exploratory factor analyses, along with a high internal consistency, suggest that the SMFQ was a unifactorial scale.

  abstract = {Behavioral researchers are increasingly conducting their studies online, to gain access to large and diverse samples that would be difficult to get in a laboratory environment. However, there are technical access barriers to building experiments online, and web browsers can present problems for consistent timing---an important issue with reaction-time-sensitive measures. For example, to ensure accuracy and test--retest reliability in presentation and response recording, experimenters need a working knowledge of programming languages such as JavaScript. We review some of the previous and current tools for online behavioral research, as well as how well they address the issues of usability and timing. We then present the Gorilla Experiment Builder (gorilla.sc), a fully tooled experiment authoring and deployment platform, designed to resolve many timing issues and make reliable online experimentation open and accessible to a wider range of technical abilities. To demonstrate the platform's aptitude for accessible, reliable, and scalable research, we administered a task with a range of participant groups (primary school children and adults), settings (without supervision, at home, and under supervision, in both schools and public engagement events), equipment (participant's own computer, computer supplied by the researcher), and connection types (personal internet connection, mobile phone 3G/4G). We used a simplified flanker task taken from the attentional network task (Rueda, Posner, \& Rothbart, 2004). We replicated the ``conflict network'' effect in all these populations, demonstrating the platform's capability to run reaction-time-sensitive experiments. Unresolved limitations of running experiments online are then discussed, along with potential solutions and some future features of the platform.},

Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is recommended for the treatment of depression in children, yet research is based primarily on adolescents. The present meta-analysis investigated the efficacy of CBT in children aged 8-12 years with regard to depressive symptoms. We included randomized controlled trials of CBT with participants who had an average age of ~{$\leq~$}12 years and were diagnosed with either depression or reported elevated depressive symptoms. The search resulted in 10 randomized controlled trials with 267 participants in intervention and 256 in comparison groups. The mean age of participants was 10.5 years. The weighted between-group effect size for CBT was moderate, Cohen's d~=~0.66. CBT outperformed both attention placebo and wait-list, although there was a significant heterogeneity among studies with regard to effect sizes. The weighted within-group effect size for CBT was large, d~=~1.02. Earlier publication year, older participants, and more treatment sessions were associated with a larger effect size. In conclusion, the efficacy of CBT in the treatment of pediatric depression symptoms was supported. Differences in efficacy, methodological shortcomings, and lack of follow-up data limit the present study and indicate areas in need of improvement.},

  abstract = {Adolescence is a peak period for the onset of depression, and it is also a time marked by substantial stress as well as neural development within the brain reward circuitry. In the current review, we provide a selective overview of current animal and human research investigating the relationship among reward processes, stress, and depression. Three separate, but related, etiological models examine the differential roles that stress may play with regard to reward dysfunction and adolescent depression. First, the reward mediation model suggests that acute and chronic stress contribute to reward deficits, which in turn, potentiate depressive symptoms and/or increase the risk for depression. Second, in line with the stress generation perspective, it is plausible that premorbid reward-related dysfunction generates stress, in particular interpersonal stress, which then leads to the manifestation of depressive symptoms. Last, consistent with a diathesis-stress model, the interaction between stress and premorbid reward dysfunction may contribute to the onset of depression. Given the equifinal nature of depression, these models could shed important light on different etiological pathways during adolescence, particularly as they may relate to understanding the heterogeneity of depression. To highlight the translational potential of these insights, a hypothetical case study is provided as means of demonstrating the importance of targeting reward dysfunction in both assessment and treatment of adolescent depression.},

Four databases were searched to September 2016 for randomised controlled trials of physical activity interventions for adolescents and young adults, 12-25 years, experiencing a diagnosis or threshold symptoms of depression. Random-effects meta-analysis was used to estimate the standardised mean difference (SMD) between physical activity and control conditions. Subgroup analysis and meta-regression investigated potential treatment effect modifiers. Acceptability was estimated using dropout. Trials were assessed against risk of bias domains and overall quality of evidence was assessed using GRADE criteria. Seventeen trials were eligible and 16 provided data from 771 participants showing a large effect of physical activity on depression symptoms compared to controls (SMD = -0.82, 95\% CI = -1.02 to -0.61, p {$<$} 0.05, I2 = 38\%). The effect remained robust in trials with clinical samples (k = 5, SMD = -0.72, 95\% CI = -1.15 to -0.30), and in trials using attention/activity placebo controls (k = 7, SMD = -0.82, 95\% CI = -1.05 to -0.59). Dropout was 11\% across physical activity arms and equivalent in controls (k = 12, RD = -0.01, 95\% CI = -0.04 to 0.03, p = 0.70). However, the quality of RCT-level evidence contributing to the primary analysis was downgraded two levels to LOW (trial-level risk of bias, suspected publication bias), suggesting uncertainty in the size of effect and caution in its interpretation. While physical activity appears to be a promising and acceptable intervention for adolescents and young adults experiencing depression, robust clinical effectiveness trials that minimise risk of bias are required to increase confidence in the current finding. The specific intervention characteristics required to improve depression remain unclear, however best candidates given current evidence may include, but are not limited to, supervised, aerobic-based activity of moderate-to-vigorous intensity, engaged in multiple times per week over eight or more weeks. Further research is needed. (Registration: PROSPERO-CRD 42015024388).},

  abstract = {Clinic-referred teens (ages 12--19) with ADHD and ODD (N = 101) were compared to community control (CC) teens, equated for age and sex, (N = 39) on a variety of psychological tasks assessing executive functioning (EF), temporal reward discounting, and time estimation and reproduction. A factor analysis reduced the EF measures to three dimensions, representing CPT Inattention, Working Memory, and CPT Inhibition. Results indicated that the ADHD group had significantly more CPT Inattention than the CC group. No differences were found for Working Memory or CPT Inhibition. The ADHD group displayed significantly greater temporal discounting of delayed hypothetical monetary rewards relative to immediate ones and manifested more impaired time reproduction, but not time estimation, than did the CC group. Main effects for level of IQ were found only on the Working Memory factor and largely did not interact with the group factor otherwise. The group differences in CPT Inattention, temporal discounting, and time reproduction were not a function of level of comorbid oppositional defiant disorder, delinquency, or anxiety--depression. Results are reasonably consistent with past research on EF and sense of time in children with ADHD and extend these findings to the adolescent age group. Problems with working memory and CPT inhibition found in prior studies of children with ADHD, however, were not evident here, perhaps owing to age-related improvements or insufficient task difficulty.},

In this Opinion article, we introduce the Embodied Predictive Interoception Coding model, which integrates an anatomical model of corticocortical connections with Bayesian active inference principles, to propose that agranular visceromotor cortices contribute to interoception by issuing interoceptive predictions. We then discuss how disruptions in interoceptive predictions could function as a common vulnerability for mental and physical illness.},

Childhood and adolescence is the core risk phase for the development of anxiety symptoms and syndromes, ranging from transient mild symptoms to full-blown anxiety disorders. This article critically reviews epidemiological evidence covering prevalence, incidence, course, and risk factors. The core challenge in this age span is the derivation of developmentally more sensitive assessment methods. Identification of characteristics that could serve as solid predictors for onset, course, and outcome will require prospective designs that assess a wide range of putative vulnerability and risk factors. This type of information is important for improved early recognition and differential diagnosis as well as prevention and treatment in this age span.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Significant questions remain regarding both the incidence patterns of mood episodes in adolescents and young adults from the community and the conversion rate from unipolar to bipolar disorders. We addressed these issues by examining data from a prospective longitudinal community study to (i) determine the cumulative incidence of mood episodes and disorders in the first three decades of life; (ii) determine the risk for first onset of depression among individuals with a previous history of hypomanic/manic episodes and vice versa; and (iii) determine the clinical and treatment characteristics of these subjects. METHODS: Using the Munich-Composite International Diagnostic Interview, clinically trained interviewers assessed mood episodes and mental disorders in 3,021 community subjects (aged 14-24 at baseline and 21-34 at third follow-up). RESULTS: The estimated cumulative incidence at age 33 was 2.9\% for manic, 4.0\% for hypomanic, 29.4\% for major depressive, and 19.0\% for minor depressive episodes; overall, 26.0\% had unipolar major depression, 4.0\% bipolar depression, 1.5\% unipolar mania, and 3.6\% unipolar hypomania (no major depression). Overall, 0.6\% and 1.8\% had unipolar mania or hypomania, respectively, without indication for even minor depression. A total of 3.6\% of the initial unipolar major depression cases subsequently developed (hypo)mania, with particularly high rates in adolescent onset depression ({$<$} 17 years: 9\%). A total of 49.6\% of the initial unipolar mania cases subsequently developed major depression and 75.6\% major or minor depression. While bipolar cases had more adverse clinical and course depression characteristics and higher treatment rates than unipolar depressed cases, bipolar cases did not significantly differ in mania characteristics from unipolar mania cases. CONCLUSIONS: Unipolar and bipolar mood disorders are more frequent than previously thought in adolescence and young adulthood, a time period when both the recognition and the intervention rates by the healthcare system are rather low. 'Conversion' to bipolar disorder is limited in initial unipolar depression, but common in initial unipolar mania. The remaining unipolar mania cases appear to be significant in terms of clinical and course characteristics and thus require more research attention to replicate these findings.},

  abstract = {Mood is an integrative and diffuse affective state that is thought to exert a pervasive effect on cognition and behavior. At the same time, mood itself is thought to fluctuate slowly as a product of feedback from interactions with the environment. Here we present a new computational theory of the valence of mood---the Integrated Advantage model---that seeks to account for this bidirectional interaction. Adopting theoretical formalisms from reinforcement learning, we propose to conceptualize the valence of mood as a leaky integral of an agent's appraisals of the Advantage of its actions. This model generalizes and extends previous models of mood wherein affective valence was conceptualized as a moving average of reward prediction errors. We give a full theoretical derivation of the Integrated Advantage model and provide a functional explanation of how an integrated-Advantage variable could be deployed adaptively by a biological agent to accelerate learning in complex and/or stochastic environments. Specifically, drawing on stochastic optimization theory, we propose that an agent can utilize our hypothesized form of mood to approximate a momentum-based update to its behavioral policy, thereby facilitating rapid learning of optimal actions. We then show how this model of mood provides a principled and parsimonious explanation for a number of contextual effects on mood from the affective science literature, including expectation- and surprise-related effects, counterfactual effects from information about foregone alternatives, action-typicality effects, and action/inaction asymmetry.

The authors propose that (a) although strong negative affect can evoke anger without appraisals, appraisals after the initial reactions conceivably might influence the later emotional experience independently of the felt displeasure; (b) maintaining that particular stimuli can automatically elicit anger does not imply that anger will be dominant; and (c) anger is frequently blended with other negative emotions such as fear. A particular stimulus' context can affect this stimulus' meaning and thus determine its effect, but if the stimulus' meaning is held constant, the stimulus will evoke the response to which it is connected. Carefully controlled experiments are required to resolve the issues raised. The theories advanced should offer testable postulates rather than untestable assertions of what processes supposedly were operating. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

Clinicians at 13 sites were provided with weekly feedback about the assessments, and clinicians at 15 sites received feedback every 90 days. Data were collected from June 1, 2006, through December 31, 2008. Intent-to-treat analyses were conducted with hierarchical linear modeling of data provided by youths, caregivers, and clinicians. RESULTS: Assessments by youths, caregivers, and clinicians indicated that youths (N=173) treated at sites where clinicians could receive weekly feedback improved faster than youths (N=167) treated at sites where clinicians did not receive weekly feedback. A dose-response analysis showed even stronger effects when clinicians viewed more feedback reports. CONCLUSIONS: Routine measurement and feedback can be used to improve outcomes for youths who receive typical home-based services in the community.},

To deal with these problems, we argue, literature within geography has turned from affect to affective atmospheres to emphasize the spatial and material aspects of affect. Yet in so doing, such literature has largely omitted the role of practices, which has simultaneously been studied in both other strands of geography and other social sciences. Simultaneously, little attention has been paid to the affective aspects of practices. This article seeks to combine the perspectives from these diverse fields. We argue for a need to understand the affective as engrained in the practices of attuning atmospheres. In this way, affect is not a noun with a clear ontological status; it only takes such status through verbal or adjectival forms as qualities of materialities connected to bodily practices of affecting and being affected. This necessitates that the lived body become an entry point for exploring how individuals actively are attuned and attune themselves and others through atmospheres.}

We investigated pretest sample size both theoretically and empirically. Using a model of the relationship of sample size to question problem prevalence, detection power of the cognitive interview technique, and probability of observing a problem, we computed the sample size necessary, under varying conditions, to detect problems. Under a range of plausible values for the model parameters, we found that additional problems continued to be detected as sample size increased. We also report on an empirical study that simulated the number of problems detected at different sample sizes. Multiple outcome measures showed a strong positive relationship between sample size and problem detection; serious problems that were not detected in small samples were consistently observed in larger samples. We discuss the implications of these findings for practice and for additional research.}

Two areas of research are covered and integrated: vigilance-avoidance of social threat stimuli and self-focused attention. There is empirical support for these processes as possible maintaining factors that are specific to patients and non-clinical samples with high levels of social anxiety. There is reasonable evidence to promote the use of attentional strategies in the treatment of social phobia, although better controlled studies are required. We propose six overlapping mechanisms that could be responsible for change: reduced vigilance; reduced avoidance; reduced self-focused attention; mindfulness; increased attentional control; increased self-esteem.},

  abstract = {Prior studies have highlighted adolescence as a period of increased risk-taking, which is postulated to result from an overactive reward system in the brain. Longitudinal studies are pivotal for testing these brain-behavior relations because individual slopes are more sensitive for detecting change. The aim of the current study was twofold: (1) to test patterns of age-related change (i.e., linear, quadratic, and cubic) in activity in the nucleus accumbens, a key reward region in the brain, in relation to change in puberty (self-report and testosterone levels), laboratory risk-taking and self-reported risk-taking tendency; and (2) to test whether individual differences in pubertal development and risk-taking behavior were contributors to longitudinal change in nucleus accumbens activity. We included 299 human participants at the first time point and 254 participants at the second time point, ranging between ages 8-27 years, time points were separated by a 2 year interval. Neural responses to rewards, pubertal development (self-report and testosterone levels), laboratory risk-taking (balloon analog risk task; BART), and self-reported risk-taking tendency (Behavior Inhibition System/Behavior Activation System questionnaire) were collected at both time points. The longitudinal analyses confirmed the quadratic age pattern for nucleus accumbens activity to rewards (peaking in adolescence), and the same quadratic pattern was found for laboratory risk-taking (BART). Nucleus accumbens activity change was further related to change in testosterone and self-reported reward-sensitivity (BAS Drive). Thus, this longitudinal analysis provides new insight in risk-taking and reward sensitivity in adolescence: (1) confirming an adolescent peak in nucleus accumbens activity, and (2) underlining a critical role for pubertal hormones and individual differences in risk-taking tendency.},

The project found that there was no systematic way of getting reliable and comparable information about which young people are involved in health research in England, what form that involvement may have taken or the impacts of involvement. There is a need to better collate and disseminate evidence on young people's involvement in research, using both existing systems and processes, and the possible development of new metrics and measures. Not having this information risks children and young people's involvement continuing to develop in a piecemeal fashion. Further research is needed about how, when and where children and young people are involved in health research, and about the impact of involvement on research and on the children and young people involved.},

METHOD: Sixty-seven adolescent suicide victims were compared with 67 demographically matched community controls. Psychiatric disorder was assessed in suicide victims using a psychological autopsy protocol and in controls using similar semistructured psychiatric interviews. Risk factors were quantified by use of the odds ratio (OR), that is, the relative frequency of the occurrence of a given condition in the suicides compared with the controls. RESULTS: The most significant psychiatric risk factors associated with adolescent suicide were major depression (OR = 27.0), bipolar mixed state (OR = 9.0), substance abuse (OR = 8.5), and conduct disorder (OR = 6.0). Substance abuse was a more significant risk factor when comorbid with affective illness than when alone (OR = 17.0 versus 3.3). The majority of depressed suicide victims had a primary affective disorder (82\%). A significant minority (31\%) of depressed suicide victims had been depressed less than 3 months. Previous suicide attempts, suicidal ideation, and homicidal ideation also were associated with adolescent suicide. CONCLUSIONS: The development of effective treatments for youth who fit the above-noted risk profiles should be given high priority.},

In the current study, we examined the stability of FN, and its relationship with depression in adolescents, over 2 years in 45 8- to 13-year-old children. From Time 1 to Time 2, FN in response to monetary loss and in response to monetary gain showed moderate to strong reliability (rs = .64 and .67, respectively); these relationships remained significant even when accounting for related variables. FN also demonstrated high within-session reliability. Moreover, the relationship between a blunted FN and greater depression observed at Time 1 was reproduced at Time 2, and the magnitude of FN at Time 1 predicted depressive symptomatology at Time 2. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that FN and its relationship with depression remain consistent over the course of development, and that FN may prospectively predict later depressive symptomatology. The current results suggest that FN may be suitable as a biomarker of depressive symptoms during adolescence.},

It also examines within-session habituation of fear-potentiated startle (electromyography, EMG) and fear of conditioned stimuli (CS) throughout extinction training as predictors of extinction retention. Participants (n = 63) underwent fear conditioning, extinction and retention and provided continuous ratings of US expectancy and EMG, as well as CS fear ratings before and after each phase. Variation in US expectancy throughout extinction and habituation of EMG and fear was entered into a regression as predictors of retention and reinstatement of levels of expectancy and fear. Greater variation in US expectancy throughout extinction training was significantly predictive of enhanced extinction performance measured at retention test, although not after reinstatement test. Slope of EMG and CS fear during extinction did not predict retention of extinction. Within-session habituation of EMG and self-reported fear is not sufficient for long-term retention of extinction learning, and models emphasizing expectation violation may result in enhanced outcomes.},

Such comparative formats can reduce the impact of numerous response biases often affecting single-stimulus items (aka rating or Likert scales). However, if scored with traditional methodology, MFC instruments produce ipsative data, whereby all individuals have a common total test score. Ipsative scoring distorts individual profiles (it is impossible to achieve all high or all low scale scores), construct validity (covariances between scales must sum to zero), criterion-related validity (validity coefficients must sum to zero), and reliability estimates. We argue that these problems are caused by inadequate scoring of forced-choice items and advocate the use of item response theory (IRT) models based on an appropriate response process for comparative data, such as Thurstone's law of comparative judgment. We show that when Thurstonian IRT modeling is applied (Brown \& Maydeu-Olivares, 2011), even existing forced-choice questionnaires with challenging features can be scored adequately and that the IRT-estimated scores are free from the problems of ipsative data.},

However, if scored with classical methodology, these questionnaires produce ipsative data, which lead to distorted scale relationships and make comparisons between individuals problematic. This research demonstrates how item response theory (IRT) modeling may be applied to overcome these problems. A multidimensional IRT model based on Thurstone?s framework for comparative data is introduced, which is suitable for use with any forced-choice questionnaire composed of items fitting the dominance response model, with any number of measured traits, and any block sizes (i.e., pairs, triplets, quads, etc.). Thurstonian IRT models are normal ogive models with structured factor loadings, structured uniquenesses, and structured local dependencies. These models can be straightforwardly estimated using structural equation modeling (SEM) software Mplus. A number of simulation studies are performed to investigate how latent traits are recovered under various forced-choice designs and provide guidelines for optimal questionnaire design. An empirical application is given to illustrate how the model may be applied in practice. It is concluded that when the recommended design guidelines are met, scores estimated from forced-choice questionnaires with the proposed methodology reproduce the latent traits well.},

Using the framework, fundamental properties of forced-choice measurement of individual differences are considered. It is shown that the scale origin for the attributes is generally identified in questionnaires using either unidimensional or multidimensional comparisons. Both dominance and ideal point models can be used to provide accurate forced-choice measurement; and the rules governing accurate person score estimation with these models are remarkably similar.},

  abstract = {Importance: Major depressive disorder is prevalent and impairing. Parsing neurocomputational substrates of reinforcement learning in individuals with depression may facilitate a mechanistic understanding of the disorder and suggest new cognitive therapeutic targets. Objective: To determine associations among computational model-derived reinforcement learning parameters, depression symptoms, and symptom changes after treatment. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this mixed cross-sectional-cohort study, individuals performed reward and loss variants of a probabilistic learning task during functional magnetic resonance imaging at baseline and follow-up. A volunteer sample with and without a depression diagnosis was recruited from the community. Participants were assessed from July 2011 to February 2017, and data were analyzed from May 2017 to May 2021. Main Outcomes and Measures: Computational model-based analyses of participants' choices assessed a priori hypotheses about associations between components of reward-based and loss-based learning with depression symptoms. Changes in both learning parameters and symptoms were then assessed in a subset of participants who received cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Results: Of 101 included adults, 69 (68.3\%) were female, and the mean (SD) age was 34.4 (11.2) years. A total of 69 participants with a depression diagnosis and 32 participants without a depression diagnosis were included at baseline; 48 participants (28 with depression who received CBT and 20 without depression) were included at follow-up (mean [SD] of 115.1 [15.6] days). Computational model-based analyses of behavioral choices and neural data identified associations of learning with symptoms during reward learning and loss learning, respectively. During reward learning only, anhedonia (and not negative affect or arousal) was associated with model-derived learning parameters (learning rate: posterior mean regression {$\beta$}\,=\,-0.14; 95\% credible interval [CrI], -0.12 to -0.03; outcome sensitivity: posterior mean regression {$\beta$}\,=\,0.18; 95\% CrI, 0.02 to 0.37) and neural learning signals (moderation of association between striatal prediction error and expected value signals: t97\,=\,-2.10; P\,=\,.04). During loss learning only, negative affect (and not anhedonia or arousal) was associated with learning parameters (outcome shift: posterior mean regression {$\beta$}\,=\,-0.11; 95\% CrI, -0.20 to -0.01) and disrupted neural encoding of learning signals (association with subgenual anterior cingulate prediction error signals: r\,=\,-0.28; P\,=\,.005). Symptom improvement following CBT was associated with normalization of learning parameters that were disrupted at baseline (reward learning rate: posterior mean regression {$\beta$}\,=\,0.15; 90\% CrI, 0.001 to 0.41; loss outcome shift: posterior mean regression {$\beta$}\,=\,0.42; 90\% CrI, 0.09 to 0.77). Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, the mapping of reinforcement learning components to symptoms of major depression revealed mechanistic features associated with these symptoms and points to possible learning-based therapeutic processes and targets.},

We established the psychometric properties of a freely available experience of service questionnaire (ESQ), based on responses from 7,067 families of patients across 41 UK providers of child and adolescent mental health services, using the two-level latent trait modeling. Responses to the ESQ were subject to strong 'halo' effects, which were thought to represent the overall positive or negative affect towards one's treatment. Two strongly related constructs measured by the ESQ were interpreted as specific aspects of global satisfaction, namely satisfaction with care, and with environment. The Care construct was sensitive to differences between less satisfied patients, facilitating individual and service-level problem evaluation. The effects of nesting within service providers were strong, with parental reports being the most reliable source of data for the between-provider comparisons. We provide a scoring protocol for converting the hand-scored ESQ to the model-based population-referenced scores with supplied standard errors, which can be used for benchmarking services as well as individual evaluations.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Schools may provide a convenient intervention setting for young people with mental health problems generally, as well as for those who are unwilling or unable to access traditional clinic-based mental health services. However, few studies focus on older adolescents, or those from ethnic minority groups. This study aims to assess the feasibility of a brief school-based psychological intervention for self-referred adolescents aged 16-19 years. METHODS: A two-arm cluster randomised controlled trial was conducted in 10 inner-city schools with block randomisation of schools. The intervention comprised a one-day CBT Stress management programme with telephone follow-up (DISCOVER) delivered by 3 psychology (2 clinical and 1 assistant) staff. The control was a waitlist condition. Primary outcomes were depression (Mood and Feelings Questionnaire; MFQ) and anxiety (Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale; RCADS-anxiety subscale). Data were analysed descriptively and quantitatively to assess feasibility. RESULTS: 155 students were enrolled and 142 (91.6\%) followed up after 3 months. Participants were predominantly female (81\%) and the mean age was 17.3 years, with equal numbers enrolled from Year 12 and Year 13. Over half (55\%) of students were from ethnic minority groups. Intraclass correlations were low. Variance estimates were calculated to estimate the sample size for a full RCT. Preliminary outcomes were encouraging, with reductions in depression (d\,=\,0.27 CI-0.49 to -0.04, p\,=\,0.021) and anxiety (d\,=\,0.25, CI-0.46 to -0.04, p\,=\,0.018) at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Results support the feasibility of a school-based, self-referral intervention with older adolescents in a definitive future full-scale trial (Trial no. ISRCTN88636606).},

METHODS: Medline, Embase, PsycINFO and Cochrane Central were searched from inception to 1st December 2020 for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of adults seeking treatment for depression from their general practitioners, that used the Revised Clinical Interview Schedule so that there was uniformity in the measurement of clinical prognostic factors, and that reported on age, gender and marital status. Individual participant data were gathered from all nine eligible RCTs (N = 4864). Two-stage random-effects meta-analyses were conducted to ascertain the independent association between: (i) age, (ii) gender and (iii) marital status, and depressive symptoms at 3-4, 6-8,{$<$}Vinod: Please carry out the deletion of serial commas throughout the article{$>$} and 9-12 months post-baseline and remission at 3-4 months. Risk of bias was evaluated using QUIPS and quality was assessed using GRADE. PROSPERO registration: CRD42019129512. Pre-registered protocol https://osf.io/e5zup/. RESULTS: There was no evidence of an association between age and prognosis before or after adjusting for depressive 'disorder characteristics' that are associated with prognosis (symptom severity, durations of depression and anxiety, comorbid panic disorderand a history of antidepressant treatment). Difference in mean depressive symptom score at 3-4 months post-baseline per-5-year increase in age = 0(95\% CI: -0.02 to 0.02). There was no evidence for a difference in prognoses for men and women at 3-4 months or 9-12 months post-baseline, but men had worse prognoses at 6-8 months (percentage difference in depressive symptoms for men compared to women: 15.08\% (95\% CI: 4.82 to 26.35)). However, this was largely driven by a single study that contributed data at 6-8 months and not the other time points. Further, there was little evidence for an association after adjusting for depressive 'disorder characteristics' and employment status (12.23\% (-1.69 to 28.12)). Participants that were either single (percentage difference in depressive symptoms for single participants: 9.25\% (95\% CI: 2.78 to 16.13) or no longer married (8.02\% (95\% CI: 1.31 to 15.18)) had worse prognoses than those that were married, even after adjusting for depressive 'disorder characteristics' and all available confounders. CONCLUSION: Clinicians and researchers will continue to routinely record age and gender, but despite their importance for incidence and prevalence of depression, they appear to offer little information regarding prognosis. Patients that are single or no longer married may be expected to have slightly worse prognoses than those that are married. Ensuring this is recorded routinely alongside depressive 'disorder characteristics' in clinic may be important.},

Methods A cohort was formed of 20 293 young adults treated with psychological therapies in eight Improving Access to Psychological Therapies services. Pre-treatment characteristics, outcomes, and moderators of differential outcomes were compared for those who were and were not NEET. Associations between outcomes and the following were assessed for those that were NEET: missing fewer sessions, attending more sessions, having a recorded diagnosis, and waiting fewer days between referral and starting treatment. Results Those who were NEET had worse outcomes: odds ratio (OR) [95\% confidence interval (CI)] for reliable recovery = 0.68 (0.63--0.74), for deterioration = 1.41 (1.25--1.60), and for attrition = 1.31 (1.19--1.43). Ethnic minority participants that were NEET had better outcomes than those that were White and NEET. Living in deprived areas was associated with worse outcomes. The intensity of treatment (high or low) did not moderate outcomes, but having more sessions was associated with improved outcomes for those that were NEET: odds (per one-session increase) of reliable recovery = 1.10 (1.08--1.12), deterioration = 0.94 (0.91--0.98), and attrition = 0.68 (0.66--0.71). Conclusions Earlier treatment, supporting those that are NEET to attend sessions, and in particular, offering them more sessions before ending treatment might be effective in improving clinical outcomes. Additional support when working with White young adults that are NEET and those in more deprived areas may also be important.},

  abstract = {In recent years, an explosion of neuroimaging studies has examined cognitive reappraisal, an emotion regulation strategy that involves changing the way one thinks about a stimulus in order to change its affective impact. Existing models broadly agree that reappraisal recruits frontal and parietal control regions to modulate emotional responding in the amygdala, but they offer competing visions of how this is accomplished. One view holds that control regions engage ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), an area associated with fear extinction, that in turn modulates amygdala responses. An alternative view is that control regions modulate semantic representations in lateral temporal cortex that indirectly influence emotion-related responses in the amygdala. Furthermore, while previous work has emphasized the amygdala, whether reappraisal influences other regions implicated in emotional responding remains unknown. To resolve these questions, we performed a meta-analysis of 48 neuroimaging studies of reappraisal, most involving downregulation of negative affect. Reappraisal consistently 1) activated cognitive control regions and lateral temporal cortex, but not vmPFC, and 2) modulated the bilateral amygdala, but no other brain regions. This suggests that reappraisal involves the use of cognitive control to modulate semantic representations of an emotional stimulus, and these altered representations in turn attenuate activity in the amygdala.},

METHODS: In a cross sectional design, 163 participants based in schools across the UK formed two age groups representing early and mid-adolescence (12 years, 5 months-16 years, 9 months vs. 16 years, 10 months-18 years, 8 months) across two conditions considering either their own (n\,=\,83) or another child's (n\,=\,80) emotional experience divided equally for high (n\,=\,80) or low (n\,=\,83) intensity mixed emotion pairs presented in vignettes about themselves or another person. They were seen individually and completed an emotion presence interview and an Analogue Emotion Scale about the emotions experienced in the condition appropriate vignette. RESULTS: Participants reported mixed emotions both sequentially and simultaneously. In particular we found that children showed that others experience emotions in a more sequential manner, while they themselves would experience more emotions in a highly simultaneous way. Emotion experience was different depending on the emotion pair and age group. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents' subjective mixed emotion experiences vary by intensity and patterns of simultaneity over time. Findings are discussed in relation to an evaluative space model of mixed emotion and applications of the AES with adolescent populations.},

  abstract = {Mental ill-health is a leading cause of disease burden worldwide. While women suffer from greater levels of mental health disorders, it remains unclear whether this gender gap differs systematically across regions and/or countries, or across the different dimensions of mental health. We analysed 2018 data from 566,829 adolescents across 73 countries for 4 mental health outcomes: psychological distress, life satisfaction, eudaemonia, and hedonia. We examine average gender differences and distributions for each of these outcomes as well as country-level associations between each outcome and purported determinants at the country level: wealth (GDP per capita), inequality (Gini index), and societal indicators of gender inequality (GII, GGGI, and GSNI). We report four main results: 1) The gender gap in mental health in adolescence is largely ubiquitous cross-culturally, with girls having worse average mental health; 2) There is considerable cross-national heterogeneity in the size of the gender gap, with the direction reversed in a minority of countries; 3) Higher GDP per capita is associated with worse average mental health and a larger gender gap across all mental health outcomes; and 4) more gender equal countries have larger gender gaps across all mental health outcomes. Taken together, our findings suggest that while the gender gap appears largely ubiquitous, its size differs considerably by region, country, and dimension of mental health. Findings point to the hitherto unrealised complex nature of gender disparities in mental health and possible incongruence between expectations and reality in high gender equal countries.,                                        {$\bullet$}               Girls have worse average mental health than boys across 4 measures of mental health.                                         {$\bullet$}               There is large heterogeneity in the size of the mental health gender gap across countries.                                         {$\bullet$}               The gap is most pronounced for psychological distress and life satisfaction.                                         {$\bullet$}               More gender equal countries have larger gender gaps in mental health.},

  abstract = {Background There are numerous observations of reward sensitivity being associated with different psychiatric disorders. Nonetheless, most studies investigating this relationship have been cross-sectional. Additionally, current knowledge is fragmentary as studies often investigate only one disorder at a time. The present study addresses these gaps by investigating whether reward sensitivity at age 13 predicts the course of nine psychopathology domains (attention and hyperactivity, autism spectrum, reactive aggression, proactive aggression, mood, anxiety, smoking, alcohol use, and cannabis use) over a 14-year follow-up period. Methods We used dimensional outcomes on 2,523 individuals over five measurement waves between ages 13 and 26 of the Dutch Tracking Adolescents' Individual Lives Survey (TRAILS). Reward sensitivity was measured with the Behavioral Activation System (BAS) scale. The longitudinal associations between reward sensitivity and psychopathology were examined using growth curve analysis within a multilevel framework. Results Reward sensitivity at age 13 was associated with changes in psychopathology over time. Reward sensitivity had a stable main effect on the future course of reactive and proactive aggression problems and anxiety problems. The effect of reward sensitivity increased over time for alcohol and cannabis use. Post-hoc analyses showed that reward sensitivity also had a stable effect on attention problems and hyperactivity and smoking when based on the fun-seeking subscale for both domains and when changing the informant who reported on attention problems and hyperactivity. No evidence was found for a longitudinal association between reward sensitivity and autism spectrum problems and mood problems. Conclusion The current study provides evidence for the long-lasting effects of reward sensitivity on the course of different domains of psychopathology.},

  abstract = {The existence of so-called `basic emotions' and their defining attributes represents a long lasting and yet unsettled issue in psychology. Recently, neuroimaging evidence, especially related to the advent of neuroimaging meta-analytic methods, has revitalized this debate in the endeavor of systems and human neuroscience. The core theme focuses on the existence of unique neural bases that are specific and characteristic for each instance of basic emotion. Here we review this evidence, outlining contradictory findings, strengths and limits of different approaches. Constructionism dismisses the existence of dedicated neural structures for basic emotions, considering that the assumption of a one-to-one relationship between neural structures and their functions is central to basic emotion theories. While these critiques are useful to pinpoint current limitations of basic emotions theories, we argue that they do not always appear equally generative in fostering new testable accounts on how the brain relates to affective functions. We then consider evidence beyond PET and fMRI, including results concerning the relation between basic emotions and awareness and data from neuropsychology on patients with focal brain damage. Evidence from lesion studies are indeed particularly informative, as they are able to bring correlational evidence typical of neuroimaging studies to causation, thereby characterizing which brain structures are necessary for, rather than simply related to, basic emotion processing. These other studies shed light on attributes often ascribed to basic emotions, such as automaticity of perception, quick onset, and brief duration. Overall, we consider that evidence in favor of the neurobiological underpinnings of basic emotions outweighs dismissive approaches. In fact, the concept of basic emotions can still be fruitful, if updated to current neurobiological knowledge that overcomes traditional one-to-one localization of functions in the brain. In particular, we propose that the structure-function relationship between brain and emotions is better described in terms of pluripotentiality, which refers to the fact that one neural structure can fulfill multiple functions, depending on the functional network and pattern of co-activations displayed at any given moment.},

Most evidence-based psychological therapies target symptoms of heightened negative affect (e.g., negative inferential style) instead of deficits in positive affect (e.g., attenuated reward response) and typically show little benefit for anhedonia. Viewing positive scenes through virtual reality (VR) has been shown to increase positive affect and holds great promise for addressing anhedonic symptoms. In this pilot study, six participants with clinically significant depression completed 13 sessions of exposure to positive scenes in a controlled VR environment. Significant decreases were found in self-reported anhedonia, depression, anxiety, and impairments in functioning from baseline to 1-month follow-up. Negative affect decreased over all 13 sessions, and positive affect increased over sessions 8--13. Results suggest that positive experiences in VR may be a novel avenue for the treatment of anhedonia in depressed individuals.},

In this study, a mathematical model of uniform response bias (URB) was defined. Ipsative measures (i.e., individual scores subject to a constant sum constraint) were proposed to minimize the effect of URB in multigroup confirmatory factor analysis to study the measurement invariance properties across different cultural groups. The method based on W. Chan and P. M. Bentler (1993, 1996) for analyzing ipsative data was extended here for analyzing multigroup data potentially contaminated by URB. A real data set based on the Chinese Personality Assessment Inventory was used to demonstrate how the proposed procedure can be applied in real-life situations.

  abstract = {Background: Grounded theory is a well-known methodology employed in many research studies. Qualitative and quantitative data generation techniques can be used in a grounded theory study. Grounded theory sets out to discover or construct theory from data, systematically obtained and analysed using comparative analysis. While grounded theory is inherently flexible, it is a complex methodology. Thus, novice researchers strive to understand the discourse and the practical application of grounded theory concepts and processes. Objective: The aim of this article is to provide a contemporary research framework suitable to inform a grounded theory study. Result: This article provides an overview of grounded theory illustrated through a graphic representation of the processes and methods employed in conducting research using this methodology. The framework is presented as a diagrammatic representation of a research design and acts as a visual guide for the novice grounded theory researcher. Discussion: As grounded theory is not a linear process, the framework illustrates the interplay between the essential grounded theory methods and iterative and comparative actions involved. Each of the essential methods and processes that underpin grounded theory are defined in this article. Conclusion: Rather than an engagement in philosophical discussion or a debate of the different genres that can be used in grounded theory, this article illustrates how a framework for a research study design can be used to guide and inform the novice nurse researcher undertaking a study using grounded theory. Research findings and recommendations can contribute to policy or knowledge development, service provision and can reform thinking to initiate change in the substantive area of inquiry.},

The psyche is understood here as a complex hierarchical structure of affective/cognitive systems of reference (or `programmes for feeling, thinking, and behaviour'), generated by repetitive concrete action. These systems store past experience in their structure, and provide the functional basis for further cognition and communication. Affects endow these programmes with a specific qualitative value (such as motivation), connect cognitive elements synchronically and diachronically, and contribute to their storage and mobilisation according to context. They also participate in differentiating cognitive systems at higher levels of abstraction. These assumptions are supported by recent findings on the role of the limbic and hypothalamic system for the regulation of emotion, on neuronal plasticity, and on the phenomenon of state-dependent learning and memory. Refutable hypotheses are formulated for further research on the interaction of emotion and cognition.},

This has adverse implications for the content validity of a measure. The aim of this paper is to identify the types of items that service users felt were important to be included or excluded from a new Recovering Quality of Life measure for people with mental health difficulties. Methods Potential items were presented to service users in face-to-face structured individual interviews and focus groups. The items were primarily taken or adapted from current measures and covered themes identified from earlier qualitative work as being important to quality of life. Content and thematic analysis was undertaken to identify the types of items which were either important or unacceptable to service users. Results We identified five key themes of the types of items that service users found acceptable or unacceptable; the items should be relevant and meaningful, unambiguous, easy to answer particularly when distressed, do not cause further upset, and be non-judgemental. Importantly, this was from the perspective of the service user. Conclusions This research has underlined the importance of service users' views on the acceptability and validity of items for use in developing a new measure. Whether or not service users favoured an item was associated with their ability or intention to respond accurately and honestly to the item which will impact on the validity and sensitivity of the measure.},

Exploratory and confirmatory factor-analytic results revealed a seven-factor model including the following factors: Cognitive Problems, Oppositional, Hyperactivity-Impulsivity, Anxious-Shy, Perfectionism, Social Problems, and Psychosomatic. The psychometric properties of the revised scale appear adequate as demonstrated by good internal reliability coefficients, high test-retest reliability, and effective discriminatory power. Advantages of the CPRS-R include a corresponding factor structure with the Conners' Teacher Rating Scale-Revised and comprehensive symptom coverage for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and related disorders. Factor congruence with the original CPRS as well as similarities with other parent rating scales are discussed.}

The overall weighted effect size was               d               =.24,               p               {$<$}.001, indicating a small but significant positive effect of outcome expectations on adaptive treatment outcomes. We also provide a narrative review of mediators of the expectation-outcome link and patient factors that relate to their outcome expectations. Finally, we discuss limitations of the research base and offer therapeutic practices based on our findings. {\copyright} 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Clin Psychol: In Session 67:184--192, 2011.},

  abstract = {Abstract           Recent interest has focused on a class of decision problems in which subjects encounter options serially and must decide when to leave an option in search of a better one, rather than directly comparing simultaneously presented options. Although such problems have a rich history in animal foraging and economics, relatively little is known about their neural substrates. Suggestively, however, a separate literature has argued that the key decision variable in these tasks -- the opportunity cost of time, given by the average reward rate -- may also govern behavioral vigor and may be reported by tonic dopamine (DA).           In this study, we test whether this putative dopaminergic opportunity cost signal plays an analogous role in serial decisions by examining the behavior of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), on and off their DA replacement medication, in a patch-foraging task. In these tasks, subjects' decisions about when to leave a depleting resource implicitly reflect their beliefs about the opportunity cost of time spent harvesting that resource. Consistent with the opportunity cost hypothesis, umedicated patients harvested longer than matched controls, and medication remediated this deficit. These effects were not explained by motor perseveration. Our results suggest a functional role for DA, and an associated cognitive deficit in PD, in a type of decision process that may be distinct from (but related to) the neuromodulator's well studied roles in behavioral invigoration and learning from rewards.                        Significance Statement             This study addresses two important questions whose answers are, unexpectedly, linked. First, what is the scope of cognitive functions of the neuromodulator dopamine, whose contributions -- for instance, as assessed by both the motoric and more subtle cognitive deficits of patients with PD, which depletes dopamine -- range from movement to reward and decision-making? Second, what are the neural mechanisms supporting an important but understudied class of problems, in which, rather than choose among a set of alternatives (like apples and oranges), one makes serial decisions about whether to stick with an option (like a job, or a mate) or seek another? We demonstrate a novel cognitive deficit in PD that integrates this function into the web of DA's contributions.},

  abstract = {Prediction errors (PEs) are a keystone for computational neuroscience. Their association with midbrain neural firing has been confirmed across species and has inspired the construction of artificial intelligence that can outperform humans. However, there is still much to learn. Here, we leverage the wealth of human PE data acquired in the functional neuroimaging setting in service of a deeper understanding, using an MKDA (multi-level kernel-based density) meta-analysis. Studies were identified with Google Scholar, and we included studies with healthy adult participants that reported activation coordinates corresponding to PEs published between 1999-2018. Across 264 PE studies that have focused on reward, punishment, action, cognition, and perception, consistent with domain-general theoretical models of prediction error we found midbrain PE signals during cognitive and reward learning tasks, and an insula PE signal for perceptual, social, cognitive, and reward prediction errors. There was evidence for domain-specific error signals--in the visual hierarchy during visual perception, and the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex during social inference. We assessed bias following prior neuroimaging meta-analyses and used family-wise error correction for multiple comparisons. This organization of computation by region will be invaluable in building and testing mechanistic models of cognitive function and dysfunction in machines, humans, and other animals. Limitations include small sample sizes and ROI masking in some included studies, which we addressed by weighting each study by sample size, and directly comparing whole brain vs. ROI-based results.},

  abstract = {Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a prevalent psychiatric disorder that has poor long-term outcomes and remains a major public health concern. Recent theories have proposed that ADHD arises from alterations in multiple neural pathways. Alterations in reward circuits are hypothesized as one core dysfunction, leading to altered processing of anticipated rewards. The nucleus accumbens (NAcc) is particularly important for reward processes; task-based fMRI studies have found atypical activation of this region while the participants performed a reward task. Understanding how reward circuits are involved with ADHD may be further enhanced by considering how the NAcc interacts with other brain regions. Here we used the technique of resting-state functional connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI) to examine the alterations in the NAcc interactions and how they relate to impulsive decision making in ADHD. Using rs-fcMRI, this study: examined differences in functional connectivity of the NAcc between children with ADHD and control children; correlated the functional connectivity of NAcc with impulsivity, as measured by a delay discounting task; and combined these two initial segments to identify the atypical NAcc connections that were associated with impulsive decision making in ADHD. We found that functional connectivity of NAcc was atypical in children with ADHD and the ADHD-related increased connectivity between NAcc and the prefrontal cortex was associated with greater impulsivity (steeper delayed-reward discounting). These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that atypical signaling of the NAcc to the prefrontal cortex in ADHD may lead to excessive approach and failure in estimating future consequences; thus, leading to impulsive behavior.},

Method The literature published in the past decade was reviewed under two headings: methods and findings. Results Methods for assessing the prevalence and community burden of child and adolescent psychiatric disorders have improved dramatically in the past decade. There are now available a broad range of interviews that generate DSM and ICD diagnoses with good reliability and validity. Clinicians and researchers can choose among interview styles (respondent based, interviewer based, best estimate) and methods of data collection (paper and pencil, computer assisted, interviewer or self-completion) that best meet their needs. Work is also in progress to develop brief screens to identify children in need of more detailed assessment, for use by teachers, pediatricians, and other professionals. The median prevalence estimate of functionally impairing child and adolescent psychiatric disorders is 12\%, although the range of estimates is wide. Disorders that often appear first in childhood or adolescence are among those ranked highest in the World Health Organization's estimates of the global burden of disease. Conclusions There is mounting evidence that many, if not most, lifetime psychiatric disorders will first appear in childhood or adolescence.

METHODS: A multistage, overlapping cohorts design was used, in which 4500 of the 11758 children aged 9, 11, and 13 years in an 11-county area of the southeastern United States were randomly selected for screening for psychiatric symptoms. Children who scored in the top 25\% on the screening questionnaire, together with a 1 in 10 random sample of the rest, were recruited for 4 waves of intensive, annual interviews (n = 1015 at wave 1). In a parallel study, all American Indian children aged 9, 11, and 13 years were recruited (N = 323 at wave 1). RESULTS: The 3-month prevalence (+/-SE) of any DSM-III-R axis I disorder in the main sample, weighted to reflect population prevalence rates, was 20.3\% +/- 1.7\%. The most common diagnoses were anxiety disorders (5.7\% +/- 1.0\%), enuresis (5.1\% +/- 1.0\%), tic disorders (4.2\% +/- 0.9\%), conduct disorder (3.3\% +/- 0.6\%), oppositional defiant disorder (2.7\% +/- 0.4\%), and hyperactivity (1.9\% +/- 0.4\%). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of psychiatric disorder in this rural sample was similar to rates reported in other recent studies. Poverty was the strongest demographic correlate of diagnosis, in both urban and rural children.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Loss of pleasure or interest in activities (i.e., anhedonia) is a risk factor for suicidality, treatment nonresponse, and relapse. Extant treatments that focus on reducing negative affect have limited effects upon positive affect (a core feature of anhedonia). We investigated whether a novel intervention aimed at increasing reward sensitivity was more efficacious for positive affect than a cognitive-behavior treatment aimed at reducing threat sensitivity, in individuals with clinically severe symptoms of depression or anxiety, and functional impairment. METHOD: The Treatment for Affective Dimensions trial was offered in a 2-site randomized study at outpatient treatment centers in Los Angeles and Dallas. Ninety-six patients were randomized to 15 weekly, individual sessions of Positive Affect Treatment (PAT) or Negative Affect Treatment (NAT). The primary outcome was improvement in positive affect (Positive and Negative Affect Schedule-Positive) from pretreatment to 6-month follow-up (6MFU). Secondary outcomes were improvements in negative affect (Positive and Negative Affect Schedule-Negative), suicidal ideation, and symptoms (Depression Anxiety Stress Scales). RESULTS: PAT resulted in greater improvements in positive affect, p = .009, d = .52, and higher positive affect at 6MFU, p = .002, d = .67, than NAT. Participants in PAT also reported lower negative affect, p = .033, d = .52, and lower symptoms of depression, p = .035, d = .34, anxiety, p {$<$} .018, d = .30, and stress, p = .006, d = .43 at 6MFU. Finally, probability of suicidal ideation at 6MFU was lower in PAT than NAT (1.7\% vs. 12.0\%), p {$<$} .001. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to NAT, PAT demonstrated better outcomes (at 6MFU) on positive affect, depression, anxiety, stress, and suicidal ideation, for patients with symptomatic pretreatment levels of these outcomes.

A popular notion emerging from this work states that a relative immaturity in frontal cortical neural systems could explain adolescents' high rates of risk-taking, substance use and other dangerous behaviours. However, developmental neuroimaging studies do not support a simple model of frontal cortical immaturity. Rather, growing evidence points to the importance of changes in social and affective processing, which begin around the onset of puberty, as crucial to understanding these adolescent vulnerabilities. These changes in social-affective processing also may confer some adaptive advantages, such as greater flexibility in adjusting one's intrinsic motivations and goal priorities amidst changing social contexts in adolescence.},

  abstract = {Adolescence is a time of marked improvements in cognitive abilities, such as abstract reasoning, problem solving and creative thought. More generally, it is also an important developmental period for maturational advancements in cognitive, affective and social capacities.At the same time, adolescence is characterized by increased risk-taking, sensation-seeking and sensitivity to social evaluation, and these contribute to a wide range of serious health consequences in adolescence, including substance use, accidents, violence and suicide.Several established models of adolescent brain development have suggested that these serious health problems emerging in adolescence can be explained by a relative immaturity in regions of the prefrontal cortex (which is thought to be important for the regulation of behaviour and emotions) in the face of rapid maturation of limbic brain regions (leading to intensification of emotions).Using a meta-analysis of functional MRI data, we examined the evidence for these changes in brain function in relation to cognitive control, social--affective processing and social--cognitive reasoning over the course of adolescent development.We conclude that the neuroimaging evidence for a slow maturation of cognitive control regions across adolescence is relatively inconsistent, with some studies reporting increases and others finding decreases in activation.We found more consistent evidence for increased limbic responses to affective stimuli such as rewards, emotional faces and social feedback, peaking in mid-adolescence.Brain regions involved in understanding others' intentions in social reasoning, such as the anterior medial prefrontal cortex and temporoparietal junction, show changes in relative contributions over the course of adolescent development.On the basis of the meta-analysis and new insights from other research, we present a heuristic model that views adolescent brain development as a period of social and affective engagement and a time of learning and flexibility in adjusting goals and priorities. A key component of this model focuses on the impact of puberty on social--affective development.},

For patients and clinicians, it is important to know whether patients achieve a clinically significant improvement or deterioration. We conducted such a meta-analysis to examine response, clinically significant change, clinically significant deterioration and recovery as outcomes. We searched four bibliographic databases and included 40 randomised trials comparing psychotherapy for youth depression against control conditions. We used a validated method to estimate outcome rates, based on means, standard deviation and N at baseline and post-test. We also calculated numbers-need-to- treat (NNT). The overall response rate in psychotherapies at 2 ({\textpm}1) months after baseline was 39\% (95\% CI: 34-45) and 24\% (95\% CI: 0.19-28) in control conditions (NNT: 6.2). The difference between therapy and control was still significant at 6-12 months after baseline (NNT=7.8). Clinically significant improvement was found in 54\% of youth in therapy, compared with 32\% in control groups (NNT=5.3); clinically significant deterioration was 6\% in therapy, 13\% in controls (NNT=5.1); recovery was 58\% in therapy, 36\% in controls (NNT=3.3). Smaller effects were found in studies with low risk of bias. Psychotherapies for depression in youth are effective compared to control conditions, but more than 60\% of youth receiving therapy do not respond. More effective treatments and treatment strategies are clearly needed. Trial registration https://osf.io/84xka.},

  abstract = {It is not clear whether psychotherapies for depression have comparable effects across the life span. Finding out is important from a clinical and scientific perspective.To compare the effects of psychotherapies for depression between different age groups.Four major bibliographic databases (PubMed, PsychINFO, Embase, and Cochrane) were searched for trials comparing psychotherapy with control conditions up to January 2019.Randomized trials comparing psychotherapies for depression with control conditions in all age groups were included.Effect sizes (Hedges g) were calculated for all comparisons and pooled with random-effects models. Differences in effects between age groups were examined with mixed-effects subgroup analyses and in meta-regression analyses.Depressive symptoms were the primary outcome.After removing duplicates, 16\,756 records were screened and 2608 full-text articles were screened. Of these, 366 trials (36\,702 patients) with 453 comparisons between a therapy and a control condition were included in the qualitative analysis, including 13 (3.6\%) in children (13 years and younger), 24 (6.6\%) in adolescents ({$\geq$}13 to 18 years), 19 (5.2\%) in young adults ({$\geq$}18 to 24 years), 242 (66.1\%) in middle-aged adults ({$\geq$}24 to 55 years), 58 (15.8\%) in older adults ({$\geq$}55 to 75 years), and 10 (2.7\%) in older old adults (75 years and older). The overall effect size of all comparisons across all age groups was g = 0.75 (95\% CI, 0.67-0.82), with very high heterogeneity (I2 = 80\%; 95\% CI: 78-82). Mean effect sizes for depressive symptoms in children (g\,=\,0.35; 95\% CI, 0.15-0.55) and adolescents (g\,=\,0.55; 95\% CI, 0.34-0.75) were significantly lower than those in middle-aged adults (g\,=\,0.77; 95\% CI, 0.67-0.87). The effect sizes in young adults (g\,=\,0.98; 95\% CI, 0.79-1.16) were significantly larger than those in middle-aged adults. No significant difference was found between older adults (g\,=\,0.66; 95\% CI, 0.51-0.82) and those in older old adults (g\,=\,0.97; 95\% CI, 0.42-1.52). The outcomes should be considered with caution because of the suboptimal quality of most of the studies and the high levels of heterogeneity. However, most primary findings proved robust across sensitivity analyses, addressing risk of bias, target populations included, type of therapy, diagnosis of mood disorder, and method of data analysis.Trials included in this meta-analysis reported effect sizes of psychotherapies that were smaller in children than in adults, probably also smaller in adolescents, that the effects may be somewhat larger in young adults, and without meaningful differences between middle-aged adults, older adults, and older old adults.},

According to the now canonical theory, reward predictions are represented as a single scalar quantity, which supports learning about the expectation, or mean, of stochastic outcomes. Here we propose an account of dopamine-based reinforcement learning inspired by recent artificial intelligence research on distributional reinforcement learning4-6. We hypothesized that the brain represents possible future rewards not as a single mean, but instead as a probability distribution, effectively representing multiple future outcomes simultaneously and in parallel. This idea implies a set of empirical predictions, which we tested using single-unit recordings from mouse ventral tegmental area. Our findings provide strong evidence for a neural realization of distributional reinforcement learning.},

It has been suggested that reward sensitivity in adolescence might be adaptive, but evidence of an adaptive role has been scarce. Using a probabilistic reinforcement learning task combined with reinforcement learning models and fMRI, we found that adolescents showed better reinforcement learning and a stronger link between reinforcement learning and episodic memory for rewarding outcomes. This behavioral benefit was related to heightened prediction error-related BOLD activity in the hippocampus and to stronger functional connectivity between the hippocampus and the striatum at the time of reinforcement. These findings reveal an important role for the hippocampus in reinforcement learning in adolescence and suggest that reward sensitivity in adolescence is related to adaptive differences in how adolescents learn from experience.},

  abstract = {Introduction Emotional disorders (such as anxiety and depression) are associated with considerable distress and impairment in day-to-day function for affected children and young people and for their families. Effective evidence-based interventions are available but require appropriate identification of difficulties to enable timely access to services. Standardised diagnostic assessment (SDA) tools may aid in the detection of emotional disorders, but there is limited evidence on the utility of SDA tools in routine care and equipoise among professionals about their clinical value. Methods and analysis A multicentre, two-arm, parallel group randomised controlled trial, with embedded qualitative and health economic components. Participants will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to either the Development and Well-Being Assessment SDA tool as an adjunct to usual clinical care, or usual care only. A total of 1210 participants (children and young people referred to outpatient, specialist Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services with emotional difficulties and their parent/carers) will be recruited from at least 6 sites in England. The primary outcome is a clinician-made diagnosis about the presence of an emotional disorder within 12 months of randomisation. Secondary outcomes include referral acceptance, diagnosis and treatment of emotional disorders, symptoms of emotional difficulties and comorbid disorders and associated functional impairment. Ethics and dissemination The study received favourable opinion from the South Birmingham Research Ethics Committee (Ref. 19/WM/0133). Results of this trial will be reported to the funder and published in full in the Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Journal series and also submitted for publication in a peer reviewed journal.

Needed directions for future research and theory include theoretically driven attention to conceptualizing informant discrepancies across informant pairs (e.g., parent-teacher, mother-father, parent-child, teacher-child) as well as developing experimental approaches to decrease informant discrepancies in the clinic setting.

We discuss where different types of PE are encoded, how they are generated, and the different functional roles they fulfill. We suggest that while encoding of PE is a common computation across brain regions, the content and function of these error signals can be very different and are determined by the afferent and efferent connections within the neural circuitry in which they arise.},

DESIGN: The present study examined SFA and safety behaviors across two therapies for SAD, cognitive behavioral group therapy (CBGT) and mindfulness and acceptance-based group therapy (MAGT). METHOD: Participants with symptoms meeting criteria for SAD (N\,=\,137) were randomly assigned to the 12-week-treatment groups (n\,=\,53 for each condition) or a waitlist control (n\,=\,31). Variables were assessed at baseline, midtreatment, posttreatment, and a 3-month follow-up. RESULTS: Both treatment conditions reported significantly lower SFA and safety behaviors compared to control, but did not differ from one another at posttreatment. Mediation analyses supported the following models: (1) safety behaviors mediating the relationship between SFA and social anxiety, and (2) SFA mediating the relationship between safety behaviors and social anxiety. These models were supported for both treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: Both treatments may have the potential to reduce the SFA and safety behaviors that serve to maintain SAD.},

In this review, we explore one possible reason for this cross-cultural difference, that Asian cultures think differently about emotion than do Western cultures and that these different systems of thought help explain why negative affect does not escalate into clinical disorder at the same rate. We review research from multiple disciplines?including cross-cultural psychology, social cognition, clinical psychology, and psychiatry?to make the case that the Eastern holistic principles of contradiction (each experience is associated with its opposite), change (the world exists in a state of constant flux), and context (the interconnectedness of all things) fundamentally shape people?s experience of emotions in different cultures. We then review evidence for how these cultural differences influence how successfully people use common emotion regulation strategies such as rumination and suppression.},

The second aspect which this book illustrates is that of following a procedure of inquiry which is well known but seldom used in the social sciences. The problem of aggressive behavior is here advanced one step along this road which all social inquiry that aspires to become truly scientific must eventually follow. This step has consisted partly in a more systematic formulation and further elaboration of the Frustration-Aggression hypothesis which had already been stated by Freud and others, and partly in bringing together a larger body of relevant illustrative material. It is therefore in the nature of a second approximation looking toward a scientific theory of aggressive behavior. It is published in its present tentative form in the hope that it will stimulate further inquiry not only at the Institute but elsewhere.

Methods Twenty three participants ages 13--18 (Mage = 14.96) engaged in user testing of a chatbot developed to psychoeducate adolescents on depression, teach behavioral activation, and change negative thoughts. Thematic analysis was conducted of participants' responses to user experience questions, impressions, and recommendations. Results Over half (56.5\%) of the sample completed the full intervention and provided user experience feedback online. The average NPS score was 6.04 (SD = 2.18), and 64.3\% (n = 9) said they would use the chatbot in the future. Of all user experience responses, 54.5\% were positive. The most common impressions were related to symptom improvement (61.1\%) and availability (52.8\%) The most frequent recommendations were related to solving technical problems (66\%). Conclusions Chatbots for mental health are acceptable to some adolescents, a population that tends to be reluctant to engage with traditional mental health services. Most participants reported positive experiences with the chatbot, believing that it could help with symptom improvement and is highly available. Adolescents highlighted some technical and stylistic problems that developers should consider. More pilot and user testing is needed to develop mental health chatbots that are appealing and relevant to adolescents.},

In recent years it has been argued that psychiatric patients are often harmed in their capacity as knowers and suffer from various forms of epistemic injustice that they encounter in psychiatric services. Acknowledging that epistemic injustice is a multifaceted problem in psychiatry calls for an adequate response. In this paper I argue that, given that psychiatric patients deserve epistemic respect and have a certain epistemic privilege, healthcare professionals have a pro tanto epistemic duty to attend to and/or solicit reports of patients' first-person experiences in order to prevent epistemic losses. I discuss the nature and scope of this epistemic duty and point to one interesting consequence. In order to prevent epistemic losses, healthcare professionals may need to provide some patients with resources and tools for expressing their experiences and first-person knowledge, such as those that have been developed within the phenomenological approach. I discuss the risk of secondary testimonial and hermeneutical injustice that the practice of relying on such external tools might pose and survey some ways to mitigate it.},

While several options now exist to analyze dynamic video data, less is known about the relative performance of these classifiers, in particular when facial expressions are spontaneous rather than posed. In the present work, we tested eight out-of-the-box automatic classifiers, and compared their emotion recognition performance to that of human observers. A total of 937 videos were sampled from two large databases that conveyed the basic six emotions (happiness, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, and disgust) either in posed (BU-4DFE) or spontaneous (UT-Dallas) form. Results revealed a recognition advantage for human observers over automatic classification. Among the eight classifiers, there was considerable variance in recognition accuracy ranging from 48\% to 62\%. Subsequent analyses per type of expression revealed that performance by the two best performing classifiers approximated those of human observers, suggesting high agreement for posed expressions. However, classification accuracy was consistently lower (although above chance level) for spontaneous affective behavior. The findings indicate potential shortcomings of existing out-of-the-box classifiers for measuring emotions, and highlight the need for more spontaneous facial databases that can act as a benchmark in the training and testing of automatic emotion recognition systems. We further discuss some limitations of analyzing facial expressions that have been recorded in controlled environments.},

The aim of this research was to explore change in standardized and idiographic outcome measures in CAMHS using naturalistic, routinely collected data. METHOD: We explored change in psychosocial difficulties and impact on daily life as evaluated by a broad standardized measure, the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) (Goodman, 1997, J. Child Psychol. Psychiatry, 38, 581) and progress toward goals as evaluated by a personalized idiographic measure, the Goal Based Outcomes tool (GBO) (Law, 2011, Goals and Goal Based Outcomes (GBOs): some useful information. London: CAMHS Press) in a sample of N = 137 CAMHS attenders. RESULTS: Psychosocial difficulties and impact on daily life showed less change over the course of treatment than progress toward goals in this study. Change in psychosocial difficulties and impact on daily life were also less strongly associated with change in clinician-reported functioning and satisfaction with care at time two than change in progress toward goals. CONCLUSIONS: Findings of the present research may support previous studies in which service users and clinicians report that idiographic measures are more capable than standardized measures of capturing relevant change for individuals.},

  abstract = {Eye-tracking experiments rely heavily on good data quality of eye-trackers. Unfortunately, it is often the case that only the spatial accuracy and precision values are available from the manufacturers. These two values alone are not sufficient to serve as a benchmark for an eye-tracker: Eye-tracking quality deteriorates during an experimental session due to head movements, changing illumination or calibration decay. Additionally, different experimental paradigms require the analysis of different types of eye movements; for instance, smooth pursuit movements, blinks or microsaccades, which themselves cannot readily be evaluated by using spatial accuracy or precision alone. To obtain a more comprehensive description of properties, we developed an extensive eye-tracking test battery. In 10 different tasks, we evaluated eye-tracking related measures such as: the decay of accuracy, fixation durations, pupil dilation, smooth pursuit movement, microsaccade classification, blink classification, or the influence of head motion. For some measures, true theoretical values exist. For others, a relative comparison to a reference eye-tracker is needed. Therefore, we collected our gaze data simultaneously from a remote EyeLink 1000 eye-tracker as the reference and compared it with the mobile Pupil Labs glasses. As expected, the average spatial accuracy of 0.57{$^\circ$} for the EyeLink 1000 eye-tracker was better than the 0.82{$^\circ$} for the Pupil Labs glasses (N = 15). Furthermore, we classified less fixations and shorter saccade durations for the Pupil Labs glasses. Similarly, we found fewer microsaccades using the Pupil Labs glasses. The accuracy over time decayed only slightly for the EyeLink 1000, but strongly for the Pupil Labs glasses. Finally, we observed that the measured pupil diameters differed between eye-trackers on the individual subject level but not on the group level. To conclude, our eye-tracking test battery offers 10 tasks that allow us to benchmark the many parameters of interest in stereotypical eye-tracking situations and addresses a common source of confounds in measurement errors (e.g., yaw and roll head movements). All recorded eye-tracking data (including Pupil Labs' eye videos), the stimulus code for the test battery, and the modular analysis pipeline are freely available (https://github.com/behinger/etcomp).},

It has been over 5 years since our meta-analyses summarised the evidence supporting and this systematic review updates those findings and examines moderators of treatment effect. Method Randomised trials of behavioural activation for depression versus controls or anti-depressant medication were identified using electronic database searches, previous reviews and reference lists. Data on symptom level and study level moderators were extracted and analysed using meta-analysis, sub-group analysis and meta-regression respectively. Results Twenty six randomised controlled trials including 1524 subjects were included in this meta-analysis. A random effects meta-analysis of symptom level post treatment showed behavioural activation to be superior to controls (SMD -0.74 CI -0.91 to -0.56, k = 25, N = 1088) and medication (SMD -0.42 CI -0.83 to-0.00, k = 4, N = 283). Study quality was low in the majority of studies and follow- up time periods short. There was no indication of publication bias and subgroup analysis showed limited association between moderators and effect size. Conclusions The results in this meta-analysis support and strengthen the evidence base indicating Behavioural Activation is an effective treatment for depression. Further high quality research with longer term follow-up is needed to strengthen the evidence base.},

  abstract = {Models of social anxiety and depression in youth have been developed separately, and they contain similar etiological influences. Given the high comorbidity of social anxiety and depression, we examine whether the posited etiological constructs are a correlate of, or a risk factor for, social anxiety and/or depression at the symptom level and the diagnostic level. We find core risk factors of temperament, genetics, and parent psychopathology (i.e., depression and anxiety) are neither necessary nor sufficient for the development of social anxiety and/or depression. Instead, aspects of children's relationships with parents and/or peers either mediates (i.e., explains) or moderates (i.e., interacts with) these core risks being related to social anxiety and/or depression. We then examine various parent- and peer-related constructs contained in the separate models of social anxiety and depression (i.e., parent-child attachment, parenting, social skill deficits, peer acceptance and rejection, peer victimization, friendships, and loneliness). Throughout our review, we report evidence for a Cumulative Interpersonal Risk model that incorporates both core risk factors and specific interpersonal risk factors. Most studies fail to consider comorbidity, thus little is known about the specificity of these various constructs to depression and/or social anxiety. However, we identify shared, differential, and cumulative risks, correlates, consequences, and protective factors. We then put forth demonstrated pathways for the development of depression, social anxiety, and their comorbidity. Implications for understanding comorbidity are highlighted throughout, as are theoretical and research directions for developing and refining models of social anxiety, depression, and their comorbidity. Prevention and treatment implications are also noted.},

  abstract = {Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and depression commonly co-occur. Identifying children with ADHD at risk for later depression may allow early intervention and prevention. Irritability is one possible mechanism linking these two disorders. It is common in ADHD and associated with later depression in the general population. Cross-sectional studies suggest an association between irritability and depression in ADHD, but longitudinal research is limited. This study followed up a clinical ADHD sample longitudinally to examine: (1) the association between childhood irritability and later depression symptoms, and (2) whether irritability persistence is important in this association. At baseline, parents (n\,=\,696) completed semi-structured interviews about their child (mean age\,=\,10.9), providing information on child psychopathology, including irritability. A subsample (n\,=\,249) was followed up after a mean of 5.4~years. Parent-completed Mood and Feelings Questionnaires provided information on depressive symptoms at follow-up. Parent-rated structured diagnostic interviews provided information on ADHD diagnosis and irritability at follow-up. Regression analyses examined associations between (i) baseline irritability and depression symptoms at follow-up, and (ii) persistent (vs. remitted) irritability and depression symptoms at follow-up. Analyses controlled for age, gender, depression symptoms, anxiety, ADHD symptoms, and ADHD medication at baseline. Baseline irritability was associated with depression symptoms at follow-up, but the association attenuated after controlling for anxiety and ADHD symptoms. Persistent irritability was associated with depression symptoms at follow-up, after including all covariates. Children with ADHD with persistent irritability are at elevated risk of developing depression symptoms. They may be a target for early intervention and prevention of depression.},

The CIB was developed more than a decade ago and has since been used in multiple studies of typically developing and high-risk samples ranging in age from newborns to adults and across a variety of cultures. In the following, the system is described, beginning with formulating the language for an observational system of parent-child interactions, continuing with the theoretical and methodological requirements of such a system, and concluding with the results of studies conducted with the system in different ages, pathological conditions, and cultural backgrounds. Associations between specific relational behaviors and specific components of the model-parent and child's physiology, representations, and social relationships - are presented to provide support for the proposed model. Longitudinal studies attesting to the stability of the parent and child's relational behavior and its prediction to stable components of the child's personality, adaptive behavior, and competence are presented using follow-up studies from infancy to adolescence. Results of these studies shed light on the development of parenting behavior as the environment where children grow and may begin to address the central question of social-emotional growth posed by Rutter and Sroufe (2000)---how do early relational patterns transform into stable personality orientations?

We sought to test the hypothesis that the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) controls interactions among specific subcortical regions that govern hedonic responses. By using optogenetic functional magnetic resonance imaging to locally manipulate but globally visualize neural activity in rats, we found that dopamine neuron stimulation drives striatal activity, whereas locally increased mPFC excitability reduces this striatal response and inhibits the behavioral drive for dopaminergic stimulation. This chronic mPFC overactivity also stably suppresses natural reward-motivated behaviors and induces specific new brainwide functional interactions, which predict the degree of anhedonia in individuals. These findings describe a mechanism by which mPFC modulates expression of reward-seeking behavior, by regulating the dynamical interactions between specific distant subcortical regions.},

Social avoidance may play an important role in depression, limiting opportunities and social skills acquisition, contributing to the maintenance of social difficulties. In the last few years, the need for studying social interactions using interactive tasks has been highlighted. This study investigated social avoidance in unmedicated depressed (n = 26) and matched healthy control (n = 26) participants, using a novel computerized social decision-making task (the TEAM task). In this task, participants choose between a social option (playing in a team with a coplayer) and an individual option (playing alone). Although the social option is more profitable from a material point of view, it can also be challenging because of social comparison and guilt feelings for failing the team. It was found that the higher the rank of the coplayer, the stronger the negative emotions (shame, guilt) reported by participants and the more they opted for the individual option. Depressed participants reported significantly less positive (happiness) and more negative (shame, guilt, disappointment) feelings regarding the task. Importantly, depressed participants chose the individual option significantly more often than controls, which led to lower gains in this group. Furthermore, as the task progressed, controls selected the individual option less often, whereas depressed participants selected the individual option more often. Our findings illustrate the importance of social avoidance in depression and how this behavior can lead to negative consequences. They also highlight the role of social comparison and guilt-related processes in underlying social avoidance in depression. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved).},

Doubts arise for a host of reasons, including a lack of transparency, ignorance, negligence, or misrepresentation of the evidence. We describe the scope of the problem and focus on how transparency is a part of the solution. A lack of measurement transparency makes it impossible to evaluate potential threats to internal, external, statistical-conclusion, and construct validity. We demonstrate that psychology is plagued by a measurement schmeasurement attitude: QMPs are common, hide a stunning source of researcher degrees of freedom, and pose a serious threat to cumulative psychological science, but are largely ignored. We address these challenges by providing a set of questions that researchers and consumers of scientific research can consider to identify and avoid QMPs. Transparent answers to these measurement questions promote rigorous research, allow for thorough evaluations of a study?s inferences, and are necessary for meaningful replication studies.},

Results A pattern of low striatal response and high medial prefrontal response to reward is evident in adolescents and adults with depression. Given the salience of social stimuli for positive affect and depression, reward function might be especially disrupted in response to social rewards. Because of changes in the dopamine system and reward function with aging, altered reward function in depression might be more evident during adolescence than later in life; however, low reward function may also be a stable characteristic of people who experience depression. Mechanisms of altered reward function in depression could include disrupted balance of corticostriatal circuit function, with disruption occurring as aberrant adolescent brain development.

To date, most evidence for heightened social reward in adolescence is found in the animal literature. Human adolescents show increased activation in fronto-striatal brain regions to rewarding social stimuli, but also to negative social stimuli, suggesting that adolescence may be a period of hypersensitivity to all social stimuli. Additional evidence from humans and animals suggest that the presence of others may heighten the value of non-social rewards; these findings should be incorporated into theories of social reward in adolescence.},

However, it is still unknown whether intranasal oxytocin administration (OT-IN) can be beneficial to residential youth who exhibit severe social-affective impairments. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subjects, sequential study to examine the effect of OT-IN on empathy and emotion recognition in 100 male adolescents living in residential youth care facilities. We also explored the moderating role of callous-unemotional traits, trauma, and dissociation in the oxytocin effect. Participants self-administered one dose of 24\,IU of oxytocin or placebo and performed experimental tasks on empathy and emotion recognition before and after the administration. The same procedure was performed one week later with the other substance. We found that empathy was increased after oxytocin administration compared to placebo and this effect was specific to individuals with high callous-unemotional traits. There was no effect of OT-IN on the overall emotion recognition, but there was a positive effect on accuracy of fear recognition. Trauma and dissociation did not moderate the oxytocin effect on empathy or emotion recognition. Our findings provided evidence of a beneficial effect of OT-IN on empathy and fear recognition in residential youth. We propose that a combination of OT-IN and psychological interventions merits further exploration, as it might be a novel promising direction for more tailored approaches and better treatment outcomes.},

Justice is one of the oldest and most central themes in philosophy, but in order to reveal the ethical dimension of our epistemic practices the focus must shift to injustice. Fricker adjusts the philosophical lens so that we see through to the negative space thatis epistemic injustice.The book explores two different types of epistemic injustice, each driven by a form of prejudice, and from this exploration comes a positive account of two corrective ethical-intellectual virtues. The characterization of these phenomena casts light on many issues, such as social power, prejudice, virtue, and the genealogy of knowledge, and it proposes a virtue epistemological account of testimony. In this ground-breaking book, the entanglements of reason and social power are traced in a newway, to reveal the different forms of epistemic injustice and their place in the broad pattern of social injustice.},

METHODS: We investigated the number of unique symptom profiles reported by 3703 depressed outpatients at the beginning of the first treatment stage of STAR*D.

A central theme emerges from these contributions: if we are to make genuine progress in explaining, predicting, and treating mental illness, we must study the systems from which psychopathology emerges. As the articles in this collection make clear, the systems that give rise to psychopathology encompass a host of components across biological, psychological, and social levels of analysis, intertwined in a web of complex interactions. The task of advancing our understanding of these systems will be a challenging one. Yet, this challenge presents a unique opportunity. From physics to ecology, there is a rapidly evolving body of interdisciplinary research dedicated to investigating complex systems. This work provides clear guidance for psychiatric research, opportunities for collaboration, and a set of tools and concepts from which we can draw in our efforts to understand mental health, helping us move toward our ultimate aim of improving the prevention and treatment of psychopathology.},

These studies indicate that oxytocin can enhance the salience of social stimuli and increase signal-to-noise ratios by modulating spiking and synaptic plasticity in the context of circuits and networks. We highlight oxytocin effects on social behavior in nontraditional organisms such as prairie voles and discuss opportunities to enhance the utility of these organisms for studying circuit-level modulation of social behaviors. We then discuss recent insights into oxytocin neuron activity during social interactions. We conclude by discussing some of the major questions and opportunities in the field ahead.},

Symptoms of social anxiety, depression, suicidal ideation, loneliness, and perceived social support were assessed via structured interviews and self-report instruments. Structural equation modeling revealed a significant direct relationship between social anxiety symptoms at baseline and suicidal ideation at 18 months post-baseline, even after controlling for baseline depressive symptoms and ideation. A second multiple mediation model revealed that baseline social anxiety had a significant indirect effect on suicidal ideation at 18 months post-baseline through loneliness at 9 months post-baseline. Social anxiety did not have a significant indirect effect on suicidal ideation through perceived social support from either parents or close friends. Findings suggest that loneliness may be particularly implicated in the relationship between social anxiety and suicidality in teens. Clinicians should assess and address feelings of loneliness when treating socially anxious adolescents.},

Observational techniques often involve recording behavior in settings that are relatively unnatural for families. However, it is argued that construct validity of observational methods depends partly on whether the findings are representative of participants' typical everyday behavior. Evidence is reviewed concerning whether observational findings are affected by the presence of the observer, and by two factors which have been neglected in the literature, namely the type of task imposed by the observer (e.g., directing parent and child to play rather than observing spontaneous interaction) and the location of the observations (e.g., clinic or laboratory rather than home). The review suggests that the presence of an observer does not necessarily distort the nature of interactions. However, the small number of studies in this area suggest that interactions in structured or artificial settings are not necessarily representative of those normally taking place at home.},

The reactivity of this region also mediated the relationship between `bodily sensibility' and social fear, translating a cognitive representation of subjective physical state into an individual personality trait that influences social interaction.

  abstract = {Background and aims: Antisocial personality disorder is an enduring mental disorder associated with significant disease burden and treatment difficulties. This is apparent within forensic populations. There is growing evidence to suggest that treatment with oxytocin could have some benefit in treating a range of psychiatric disorders. There are no reviews studying the use of oxytocin for patients with ASPD. We aim to present the first literature review on the use of oxytocin in patients with ASPD., Method: We searched relevant databases for original research on effect of oxytocin upon persons with a diagnosis of ASPD or healthy participants with symptoms seen in ASPD. Studies were included if they included healthy participants that evaluated the effect of oxytocin on symptoms relevant to ASPD, including empathy, inhibitory control, compliance, conformity, aggression, violence, and moral responsibility., Results: Thirty-six studies were included. There were a range of study designs, including randomized controlled trials, double blinded, single blinded, and unblinded controlled trials. The sample sizes in studies ranged from 20 to 259 participants. Studies looked at participants with a diagnosis of ASPD and participants with symptoms relevant to ASPD, including empathy, inhibitory control, compliance, conformity, aggression, violence, and moral responsibility. Oxytocin was found to demonstrate diversified effects, in most cases being associated with socially positive or non-criminogenic behaviors. However, some studies found opposite, and non-desirable, effects, e.g., an increase in violent inclinations to partners. The two studies looking at participants with ASPD had a number of limitations and had conflicting results on the impact that OT has on aggression in ASPD., Conclusions: This is the first systematic literature review exploring the potential use of oxytocin in managing ASPD and the symptoms of ASPD. It is apparent that there is a body of evidence addressing related symptoms in healthy individuals. There were diversified effects with oxytocin showing some benefits in promoting positive effects on symptoms of ASPD, but there were also studies showing non-desirable effects. It is difficult to draw any direct inferences from healthy control studies. Further high quality large sample studies are required to explore the effects of oxytocin in those with ASPD},

However, power analysis is flawed in that a narrow emphasis on statistical significance is placed as the primary focus of study design. In noisy, small-sample settings, statistically significant results can often be misleading. To help researchers address this problem in the context of their own studies, we recommend design calculations in which (a) the probability of an estimate being in the wrong direction (Type S [sign] error) and (b) the factor by which the magnitude of an effect might be overestimated (Type M [magnitude] error or exaggeration ratio) are estimated. We illustrate with examples from recent published research and discuss the largest challenge in a design calculation: coming up with reasonable estimates of plausible effect sizes based on external information.},

While prior research has focused either on respondents' or partners' controlling behaviors, an interactionist perspective provides the basis for hypothesizing that both respondent and partner control will be significantly related to the odds of reporting perpetration, and that emotional processes are a component of IPV experiences. Analyses rely on interview data collected at waves 1 and 5 of a longitudinal study (Toledo Adolescent Relationships Study; n = 928) of adolescent and young adult relationships. Results indicate that after controlling for traditional predictors, both respondent and partner control attempts and measures of anger (including a measure of relationship-based anger) contributed significantly to the odds of reporting perpetration. Further, these patterns did not differ by gender, indicating some areas of similarity in the relationship and emotional processes associated with variations in men and women's IPV reports.},

Pubertal development was significantly related to structural volume in all six regions in both sexes. Pubertal development and age had both independent and interactive influences on volume for the amygdala, hippocampus and putamen in both sexes, and the caudate in females. There was an interactive puberty-by-age effect on volume for the NA and GP in both sexes, and the caudate in males.

The two sets of measures did not differ in their ability to discriminate between psychiatric and dental clinic attenders. These preliminary findings suggest that the SDQ functions as well as the Rutter questionnaires while offering the following additional advantages: a focus on strengths as well as difficulties; better coverage of inattention, peer relationships, and prosocial behaviour; a shorter format; and a single form suitable for both parents and teachers, perhaps thereby increasing parent-teacher correlations.},

This review takes an evolutionary perspective and characterizes emotion in terms of response tendencies. Emotion regulation is defined and distinguished from coping, mood regulation, defense, and affect regulation. In the increasingly specialized discipline of psychology, the field of emotion regulation cuts across traditional boundaries and provides common ground. According to a process model of emotion regulation, emotion may be regulated at five points in the emotion generative process: (a) selection of the situation, (b) modification of the situation, (c) deployment of attention, (d) change of cognitions, and (e) modulation of responses. The field of emotion regulation promises new insights into age-old questions about how people manage their emotions. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)},

The main objectives of the current study were to examine associations of mental distress with academic self-efficacy and study progress. A secondary aim was to examine mental health help seeking for students with mental distress. Data was derived from the Norwegian Students' health and welfare survey 2014 (SHOT 2014) which is the first major survey comprising questions of both mental health, academic self-efficacy and psychosocial factors amongst students. Utilizing these data for a Norwegian region, we found that 749 (31\%) of the 2430 Norwegian full-time students under the age of 35 responded to the survey. Symptoms of mental distress were measured using the Hopkins Symptom Checklist (HSCL-25) and academic self-efficacy was measured using a Norwegian version of the General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSE) tailored to the academic setting. Demographic-, social, lifestyle, and study-related variables were included in the analyses. Logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the relationship between mental distress, academic self-efficacy, and academic performance. Seventeen percent reported severe symptoms of psychological distress which is similar to the overall prevalence among students in Norway. Students reporting severe mental distress were four times as likely to report low academic self-efficacy and twice as likely to report delayed study progress compared to students reporting few or moderate symptoms of mental distress. 27\% of those reporting severe mental distress had sought professional help whereas 31\% had considered seeking help. The study showed that there was a strong association between symptoms of mental distress, academic self-efficacy and study progress. Prospective studies should evaluate whether improved help-seeking and psychological treatment can promote students mental health and ultimately improve academic self-efficacy and study progress.},

We argue that one of the most divisive factors in psychological science is whether researchers choose to use computational modeling of theories (over and above data) during the scientific-inference process. Modeling is undervalued yet holds promise for advancing psychological science. The inherent demands of computational modeling guide us toward better science by forcing us to conceptually analyze, specify, and formalize intuitions that otherwise remain unexamined?what we dub open theory. Constraining our inference process through modeling enables us to build explanatory and predictive theories. Here, we present scientific inference in psychology as a path function in which each step shapes the next. Computational modeling can constrain these steps, thus advancing scientific inference over and above the stewardship of experimental practice (e.g., preregistration). If psychology continues to eschew computational modeling, we predict more replicability crises and persistent failure at coherent theory building. This is because without formal modeling we lack open and transparent theorizing. We also explain how to formalize, specify, and implement a computational model, emphasizing that the advantages of modeling can be achieved by anyone with benefit to all.},

This increased attention to peer evaluation has implications for emotion regulation in adolescence, but little is known about the characteristics of the evaluatee and evaluator that influence emotional reactions to evaluative outcomes. The present study used a computer-based social evaluation task to examine predictors of adolescents' emotional responses to feedback from unknown peers. Nine-to-seventeen-year-olds (N = 36) completed the ``chatroom task'' and indicated the degree to which each peer would be interested in interacting with them and how good they felt after receiving acceptance and rejection feedback from peers. We examined whether adolescents' age and gender impacted their emotional responses to being accepted or rejected by peers of different age groups (i.e., early or middle adolescence) and genders. We also tested whether expectations about peers' interest was associated with variability in adolescents' emotional responses to the evaluative outcome. Upon being accepted by middle adolescent male peers, females in the middle relative to early years of adolescence reported greater well-being, whereas males reported similar levels of well-being regardless of their own age. Following acceptance from middle adolescent female peers, females reported greater well-being than males. Adolescents with high expectations for being liked by peers felt better after being accepted versus rejected relative to those with low expectations. For adolescents with low expectations, acceptance and rejection were associated with similar levels of well-being. Adolescents' emotional responses to peer evaluation are influenced by specific individual characteristics and antecedent preparation for evaluation that may serve an emotion regulatory purpose.},

The key structures in this network are the anterior cingulate cortex, the orbital prefrontal cortex, the ventral striatum, the ventral pallidum, and the midbrain dopamine neurons. In addition, other structures, including the dorsal prefrontal cortex, amygdala, hippocampus, thalamus, and lateral habenular nucleus, and specific brainstem structures such as the pedunculopontine nucleus, and the raphe nucleus, are key components in regulating the reward circuit. Connectivity between these areas forms a complex neural network that mediates different aspects of reward processing. Advances in neuroimaging techniques allow better spatial and temporal resolution. These studies now demonstrate that human functional and structural imaging results map increasingly close to primate anatomy.},

A previous study of spontaneous imagery [Hackmann, A., Surawy, C. \& Clark, D. M. (1998) Seeing yourself through others' eyes: a study of spontaneously occurring images in social phobia. Behavioural and Cognitive Psychotherapy, 26, 3-12] confirmed that patients with social phobia frequently report experiencing negative, distorted, observer-perspective images when in anxiety provoking social situations. In the present study, 22 patients with social phobia were given a semistructured interview which aimed to further explore the nature of social phobic imagery. All participants were able to identify negative spontaneous images that were recurrent in the sense that their content appeared to be relatively stable over time and across different feared social situations. Most recurrent images involved several sensory modalities. Most recurrent images were linked to memories of adverse social events that clustered in time around the onset of the disorder. Taken together, the results suggest that in patients with social phobia, early unpleasant experiences may lead to the development of excessively negative images of their social selves that are repeatedly activated in subsequent social situations and fail to update in the light of subsequent, more favourable experiences. Implications of the findings for the understanding and treatment of social phobia are discussed.},

In Study 1, participants made reward predictions following the cue, but prior to their gambling choice; in Study 2, predictions were made following their gambling choice. Predicted and unpredicted outcomes were associated with equivalent feedback negativities in Study 1. In Study 2, however, the feedback negativity was larger for unpredicted outcomes.

In addition to describing the methods and aspects of their implementation, the paper also contains several examples and a comparison of the various methods.},

Currently, there are no established clinician-rated instruments to assess irritability in pediatric research and clinical settings. Clinician-rated measures ensure consistency of assessment across patients and are important specifically for treatment research. Here, we present data on the psychometric properties of the Clinician Affective Reactivity Index (CL-ARI), the first semistructured interview focused on pediatric irritability. The CL-ARI was administered to a transdiagnostic sample of 98 youth (M age\,=\,12.66, SD\,=\,2.47; 41\% female). With respect to convergent validity, CL-ARI scores were (a) significantly higher for youth with DMDD than for any other diagnostic group, and (b) showed uniquely strong associations with other clinician-, parent-, and youth-report measures of irritability compared to measures of related constructs, such as anxiety. The three subscales of the CL-ARI (temper outbursts, irritable mood, impairment) showed excellent internal consistency. Test-retest reliability of the CL-ARI was adequate. These data support that irritability can be feasibly, validly, and reliably assessed by clinicians using the CL-ARI. A validated, gold-standard assessment of pediatric irritability is critical in advancing research and treatment efforts.},

Findings highlight how contemporary adolescents engage with and challenge received conceptions of gender and sexuality and how this process is shaped by intersectional identities.},

Novel approaches to understanding of antidepressant drug action include a focus on early changes in emotional and social processing and the role of neural plasticity. In this Review, we discuss the ways in which these two different theories reflect different or complementary approaches, and how they might be integrated to offer novel solutions for people with depression. We consider the predictions made by these mechanistic approaches for the stratification and development of new therapeutics for depression, and the next steps that need to be made to facilitate this translation of science to the clinic.},

  abstract = {Reviews into universal interventions to improve help seeking in young people focus on specific concepts, such as behaviour, do not differentiate between interpersonal and intrapersonal help seeking, and often report on statistical significance, rather than effect size. The aim of this review was to address the gaps highlighted above, to investigate the impact of~universal, school-based interventions on help-seeking in children and young people, as well as to explore longer term impact. Four databases were searched. Data were extracted on country of origin, design, participant, school, and intervention characteristics, the help-seeking concept measured (e.g. knowledge, attitude/intention, behaviour), the duration between baseline and each follow-up (if applicable) and effect sizes at each follow-up. Quality assessment of the studies was undertaken using the Effective Public Health Practice Project (EPHPP) quality assessment tool. Overall, 14 different interventions met inclusion criteria. The majority of the studies were rated low in the quality assessment. Three constructs were most frequently reported a) intrapersonal attitudes towards help-seeking, b) interpersonal attitudes towards help-seeking and c) intrapersonal intended help-seeking. Findings around intervention effect were mixed. There was tentative evidence that interventions impacting interpersonal attitudes produced small effect sizes when measured between 3 and 6~months post intervention and that when effect sizes were initially observed intrapersonal attitudes, this remained at 3-6~month follow-up. Further work should pay attention to implementation factors, understanding the core ingredients needed to deliver effective interventions and whether embedding mental health education could help sustain or top up effect sizes from help-seeking interventions.},

This upward trend is largely accounted for by escalating symptoms of anxiety and depression. As part of a public health response, there is increasing emphasis on universal prevention programmes delivered in school settings.

Overall, 144 secondary schools in England will be recruited, involving 8600 Year 9 pupils. The primary outcome for YAM is depressive symptoms, and for The Guide it is intended help-seeking. These will be measured at baseline, 3--6 months and 9--12 months after the intervention commenced. Secondary outcomes measured concurrently include changes to: positive well-being, behavioural difficulties, support from school staff, stigma-related knowledge, attitudes and behaviours, and mental health first aid. An economic evaluation will assess the cost-effectiveness of the interventions, and a process and implementation evaluation (including a qualitative research component) will explore several aspects of implementation (fidelity, quality, dosage, reach, participant responsiveness, adaptations), social validity (acceptability, feasibility, utility), and their moderating effects on the outcomes of interest, and perceived impact.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Ethics and dissemination{$<$}/h3{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}This trial has been approved by the University College London Research Ethics Committee.

  abstract = {Individual differences in cognitive paradigms are increasingly employed to relate cognition to brain structure, chemistry, and function. However, such efforts are often unfruitful, even with the most well established tasks. Here we offer an explanation for failures in the application of robust cognitive paradigms to the study of individual differences. Experimental effects become well established - and thus those tasks become popular - when between-subject variability is low. However, low between-subject variability causes low reliability for individual differences, destroying replicable correlations with other factors and potentially undermining published conclusions drawn from correlational relationships. Though these statistical issues have a long history in psychology, they are widely overlooked in cognitive psychology and neuroscience today. In three studies, we assessed test-retest reliability of seven classic tasks: Eriksen Flanker, Stroop, stop-signal, go/no-go, Posner cueing, Navon, and Spatial-Numerical Association of Response Code (SNARC). Reliabilities ranged from 0 to .82, being surprisingly low for most tasks given their common use. As we predicted, this emerged from low variance between individuals rather than high measurement variance. In other words, the very reason such tasks produce robust and easily replicable experimental effects - low between-participant variability - makes their use as correlational tools problematic. We demonstrate that taking such reliability estimates into account has the potential to qualitatively change theoretical conclusions. The implications of our findings are that well-established approaches in experimental psychology and neuropsychology may not directly translate to the study of individual differences in brain structure, chemistry, and function, and alternative metrics may be required.},

Individual cognitive therapy (ICT) and cognitive behavioral group therapy (CBGT) both have substantial empirical support. However, it is unclear whether they achieve their effects by similar or different mechanisms. The aim of this study was to investigate whether changes in the four maintenance processes mediate clinical improvement in ICT and CBGT for SAD. We analyzed data from participants (N = 94) who received either ICT or CBGT in two separate RCTs. The results showed that ICT had larger effects than CBGT on social anxiety and each of the four potential mediators. More pertinently, moderated mediation analyses revealed significant between-treatment differences. Whereas improvement in ICT was mainly mediated by reductions in avoidance and self-focused attention, improvement in CBGT was mediated by changes in self-focused attention and in anticipatory and post-event processing. These results support the importance of the putative mediators, but suggest that their relative weights are moderated by treatment type.},

METHOD: Three hundred and eighty-two patients from several studies of the treatment of social phobia were evaluated. An independent assessor administered the LSAS to each patient prior to the initiation of treatment. Patients also completed other measures of social anxiety and avoidance, although the specific measures varied across samples. RESULTS: The LSAS and its subscales were normally distributed and demonstrated excellent internal consistency. The convergent validity of the LSAS was demonstrated via significant correlations with other commonly-used measures of social anxiety and avoidance. These correlations also tended to be larger than correlations with measures of depression, especially after treatment. However, the pattern of correlations of LSAS subscales with one another and with the other measures suggest that the fear subscales and the avoidance subscales may not be sufficiently distinct in clinical samples. The LSAS was also demonstrated to be sensitive to the effects of pharmacological treatments of social phobia over time and in comparison to double-blind pill placebo. CONCLUSION: The LSAS appears to be a reliable, valid and treatment sensitive measure of social phobia. Further study of the LSAS, both in samples with severe social phobia and in community samples, is needed.},

REVIEW METHODS: Original research studies were selected, data were extracted and quality was appraised. RESULTS: Sixteen primary papers were included, ranging from healthy and community samples to subclinical and clinical populations across a variety of age ranges and using different neurobiological measures (e.g. magnetic resonance imaging, electroencephalography, cortisol, brain-derived neurotropic factor). DISCUSSION: The majority of studies report improvement in mental health and cognition outcomes following longer-term physical activity interventions which coincide with neurobiological alterations, especially neuroimaging alterations in activation and electrophysiological parameters in frontal areas. Future research should include measures of pre-existing fitness and target those who would benefit the most from this type of intervention (e.g. those with a lower level of fitness and at risk for or with mental health problems).},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cluster randomised controlled trials (CRCTs) are frequently used in health service evaluation. Assuming an average cluster size, required sample sizes are readily computed for both binary and continuous outcomes, by estimating a design effect or inflation factor. However, where the number of clusters are fixed in advance, but where it is possible to increase the number of individuals within each cluster, as is frequently the case in health service evaluation, sample size formulae have been less well studied. METHODS: We systematically outline sample size formulae (including required number of randomisation units, detectable difference and power) for CRCTs with a fixed number of clusters, to provide a concise summary for both binary and continuous outcomes. Extensions to the case of unequal cluster sizes are provided. RESULTS: For trials with a fixed number of equal sized clusters (k), the trial will be feasible provided the number of clusters is greater than the product of the number of individuals required under individual randomisation (nI) and the estimated intra-cluster correlation ({$\rho$}). So, a simple rule is that the number of clusters (k) will be sufficient provided: [formula in text]. Where this is not the case, investigators can determine the maximum available power to detect the pre-specified difference, or the minimum detectable difference under the pre-specified value for power. CONCLUSIONS: Designing a CRCT with a fixed number of clusters might mean that the study will not be feasible, leading to the notion of a minimum detectable difference (or a maximum achievable power), irrespective of how many individuals are included within each cluster.},

We first cover the conceptual issues of prevalence, diagnostic practices, diversity, comorbidity, and causal factors, plus forces limiting awareness of ADHD in females. After a narrative review of cross-sectional and longitudinal findings, we conclude the following. (a) Girls meet diagnostic criteria for ADHD at just under half the rates of boys, a ratio that becomes much closer to equal by adulthood. (b) Girls and women with ADHD show a predominance of inattention and associated internalizing problems; boys and men display greater levels of hyperactive-impulsive symptoms and associated externalizing problems. (c) Sex differences in ADHD symptoms and related outcomes depend heavily on the clinical versus nonreferred nature of the samples under investigation. (d) Females with ADHD experience, on average, serious impairments, with a particularly heightened risk for problems in close relationships and engagement in self-harm. (e) Clinicians may overlook symptoms and impairments in females because of less overt (but still impairing) symptom manifestations in girls and women and their frequent adoption of compensatory strategies. Our review of predictors and mediators of adult outcomes highlights (a) the potential for heterotypically continuous pathways in females with childhood ADHD and (b) developmental progressions to self-harm, intimate partner violence, unplanned pregnancy, and comorbid psychopathology. Focusing on ADHD in females is necessary to characterize causal and maintaining mechanisms with accuracy and to foster responsive interventions, as highlighted in our closing list of clinical implications and research priorities.},

It is striking therefore that research has tended to examine cognitive biases in isolation rather than assessing how they work together to maintain psychological dysfunction. The combined cognitive biases hypothesis presented here suggests that cognitive biases influence each another and can interact to maintain a given disorder. Furthermore, it is proposed that the combined effects of cognitive biases may have a greater impact on sustaining a given disorder than if the biases operated in isolation. The combined cognitive biases hypothesis is examined in relation to imagery and interpretation in social phobia. Individuals with social phobia experience negative images of themselves performing poorly in social situations, and they also interpret external social information in a less positive way than those without social anxiety. Evidence of a reciprocal relationship between imagery and interpretations is presented, and the mechanisms underlying the combined effects are discussed. Clinical implications and the potential utility of examining the combined influence of other cognitive biases are highlighted.},

Compared to the control image condition, when participants held the negative image in mind they experienced greater anxiety, rated their anxiety symptoms as being more visible, and rated their performance as poorer. An assessor who did not know which image was being held also rated participants' anxiety as more evident and their behaviour as less positive when the negative image was being held in mind. Finally, when participant and assessor ratings were compared, participants underestimated their performance and overestimated the visibility of their anxiety to a significantly greater extent in the negative imagery condition.

The general argument is that in societies with greater economic inequality, the negative sanctioning-based moral emotions of anger, contempt, disgust, shame, and the like will be more frequent and severe. Societies with lower levels of inequality will conversely normalize and exhibit the more positive moral emotions of self-transcendence (compassion, praise, and empathy). Inequality thus begets negative moral emotions. These various emotional reactions to moral events not only affect everyday interaction, but also overlap with criminal justice systems' reactions to those who offend societies' moral codes. The more negative the moral reaction in a society, the more likely events are to prompt feelings associated with condemning others, the more the criminal justice system will be similarly focused on sanctioning as opposed to rehabilitation.},

The emotion-management perspective draws on an interactive account of emotion. It differs from the dramaturgical perspective on the one hand and the psychoanalytic perspective on the other. It allows us to inspect at closer range than either of those perspectives the relation among emotive experience, emotion management, feeling rules, and ideology. Feeling rules are seen as the side of ideology that deals with emotion and feeling. Emotion management is the type of work it takes to cope with feeling rules. Meaning-making jobs, more common in the middle class, put more premium on the individual's capacity to do emotion work. A reexamination of class differences in child rearing suggest that middle-class families prepare their children for emotion management more and working-class families prepare them less. In this way each prepares its children to psychologically reproduce the class structure.}

  abstract = {In private life, we try to induce or suppress love, envy, and anger through deep acting or "emotion work," just as we manage our outer expressions of feeling through surface acting. In trying to bridge a gap between what we feel and what we "ought" to feel, we take guidance from "feeling rules" about what is owing to others in a given situation. Based on our private mutual understandings of feeling rules, we make a "gift exchange" of acts of emotion management. We bow to each other not simply from the waist, but from the heart.But what occurs when emotion work, feeling rules, and the gift of exchange are introduced into the public world of work? In search of the answer, Arlie Russell Hochschild closely examines two groups of public-contact workers: flight attendants and bill collectors. The flight attendant's job is to deliver a service and create further demand for it, to enhance the status of the customer and be "nicer than natural." The bill collector's job is to collect on the service, and if necessary, to deflate the status of the customer by being "nastier than natural." Between these extremes, roughly one-third of American men and one-half of American women hold jobs that call for substantial emotional labor. In many of these jobs, they are trained to accept feeling rules and techniques of emotion management that serve the company's commercial purpose.Just as we have seldom recognized or understood emotional labor, we have not appreciated its cost to those who do it for a living. Like a physical laborer who becomes estranged from what he or she makes, an emotional laborer, such as a flight attendant, can become estranged not only from her own expressions of feeling (her smile is not "her" smile), but also from what she actually feels (her managed friendliness). This estrangement, though a valuable defense against stress, is also an important occupational hazard, because it is through our feelings that we are connected with those around us. On the basis of this book, Hochschild was featured in Key Sociological Thinkers, edited by Rob Stones. This book was also the winner of the Charles Cooley Award in 1983, awarded by the American Sociological Association and received an honorable mention for the C. Wright Mills Award. Read More {$>$}},

Eighty patients with social phobia were randomized to 10-week residential cognitive (RCT) or residential interpersonal psychotherapy (RIPT). They completed process measures every Thursday and a sub-outcome measure every Monday. The ratings were analyzed with mixed models. Weekly changes in the process variables derived from the cognitive model (self-focus, estimated probability and estimated cost of negative social events, safety behaviors) predicted subsequent weekly changes in social anxiety. Changes in the interpersonal variable perceived acceptance by others also predicted subsequent changes in social anxiety. On the other hand, changes in social anxiety predicted changes in the four cognitive variables. There were no interactive effects of process with treatment. The cognitive variables decreased during treatment to a similar degree in both treatments. The results indicate that, to reduce social anxiety, therapy should target self-focus, estimated probability and cost of feared social events, safety behaviors, and perceived acceptance by others. The process of improvement may involve positive cycles in that a reduction of social anxiety, in turn, appeared to impact self-focus, probability, cost, and safety behaviors.},

The present debate usually addresses naturalistic reification, i.e., the definition of mental illness as an empirically detectable neurobiological dysfunction. This chapter discusses Kraepelin's and Bleuler's views on nosology and the position of current operationalized diagnoses (DSM-5, ICD-10), delineating recent debate on the relevance of new research technologies.There are two main conclusions: (1) ``Mental illness'' always refers to a concept, not to a given thing. This does not reduce the scientific value of neurobiological research: If subjective and interpersonal phenomena are acknowledged although they do not fit into a strictly naturalistic framework, sound neurobiological research will be promoted, not hampered. (2) Diagnostic and therapeutic processes in psychiatry require human interaction, so any model of mental illness must address interpersonality. Recent phenomenological concepts support this view and it seems particularly promising to reevaluate the philosophical approaches of Kant and Fichte in this respect.},

Yet, no systematic review has been carried out to date to examine rates of both anxiety and depression focusing specifically on adults with ASD. This systematic review and meta-analysis examined the rates of anxiety and depression in adults with ASD and the impact of factors such as assessment methods and presence of comorbid intellectual disability (ID) diagnosis on estimated prevalence rates. Electronic database searches for studies published between January 2000 and September 2017 identified a total of 35 studies, including 30 studies measuring anxiety (n = 26 070; mean age = 30.9, s.d. = 6.2 years) and 29 studies measuring depression (n = 26 117; mean age = 31.1, s.d. = 6.8 years). The pooled estimation of current and lifetime prevalence for adults with ASD were 27\% and 42\% for any anxiety disorder, and 23\% and 37\% for depressive disorder. Further analyses revealed that the use of questionnaire measures and the presence of ID may significantly influence estimates of prevalence. The current literature suffers from a high degree of heterogeneity in study method and an overreliance on clinical samples. These results highlight the importance of community-based studies and the identification and inclusion of well-characterized samples to reduce heterogeneity and bias in estimates of prevalence for comorbidity in adults with ASD and other populations with complex psychiatric presentations.},

Imagery has a particularly powerful effect on emotion and as such plays a particularly important role in emotional disorders.

The authors suggest that, in depression, imagery can exacerbate the effects of interpretation bias. This article outlines an experimental psychopathology subcomponents model of depression that focuses specifically on the role of imagery and interpretation bias in the maintenance of the disorder. The authors propose that negative intrusive imagery, a lack of positive imagery, and negative interpretation bias serve both independently and interactively to maintain depressed mood. Finally, the authors consider the implications of this imagery-based approach for the development of new cognitive treatments in this area.},

  abstract = {The free energy principle (FEP) has gained widespread interest and growing acceptance as a new paradigm of brain function, but has had little impact on the theory and practice of psychotherapy. The aim of this paper is to redress this. Brains rely on Bayesian inference during which ``bottom-up'' sensations are matched with ``top-down'' predictions. Discrepancies result in ``prediction error.'' The brain abhors informational ``surprise,'' which is minimized by (1) action enhancing the statistical likelihood of sensory samples, (2) revising inferences in the light of experience, updating ``priors'' to reality-aligned ``posteriors,'' and (3) optimizing the complexity of our generative models of a capricious world. In all three, free energy is converted to bound energy. In psychopathology energy either remains unbound, as in trauma and inhibition of agency, or manifests restricted, anachronistic ``top-down'' narratives. Psychotherapy fosters client agency, linguistic and practical. Temporary uncoupling bottom-up from top-down automatism and fostering scrutinized simulations sets a number of salutary processes in train. Mentalising enriches Bayesian inference, enabling experience and feeling states to be ``metabolized'' and assimilated. ``Free association'' enhances more inclusive sensory sampling, while dream analysis foregrounds salient emotional themes as ``attractors.'' FEP parallels with psychoanalytic theory are outlined, including Freud's unpublished project, Bion's ``contact barrier'' concept, the Fonagy/Target model of sexuality, Laplanche's therapist as ``enigmatic signifier,'' and the role of projective identification. The therapy stimulates patients to become aware of and revise the priors' they bring to interpersonal experience. In the therapeutic ``duet for one,'' the energy binding skills and non-partisan stance of the analyst help sufferers face trauma without being overwhelmed by psychic entropy. Overall, the FEP provides a sound theoretical basis for psychotherapy practice, training, and research.},

  abstract = {Individual differences in decision-making are important in both normal populations and psychiatric conditions. Variability in decision-making could be mediated by different subjective utilities or by other processes. For example, while traditional economic accounts attribute risk aversion to a concave subjective utility curve, in practice other factors could affect risk behavior. This distinction may have important implications for understanding the biological basis of variability in decision-making and for developing interventions to improve decision-making. Another aspect of decision-making that may vary between individuals is the sensitivity of subjective utility to counterfactual outcomes (outcomes that could have occurred, but did not). We investigated decision-making in relation to hedonic capacity and trait anxiety, two traits that relate to psychiatric conditions but also vary in the general population. Subjects performed a decision-making task, in which they chose between low- and high-risk gambles to win 0, 20, or 40 points on each trial. Subjects then rated satisfaction after each outcome on a visual analog scale, indicating subjective utility. Hedonic capacity was positively associated with the subjective utility of winning 20 points but was not associated with the concavity of the subjective utility curve (constructed using the mean subjective utility of winning 0, 20, or 40 points). Consistent with economic theory, concavity of the subjective utility curve was associated with risk aversion. Hedonic capacity was independently associated with risk seeking (i.e., not mediated by the shape of the subjective utility curve), while trait anxiety was unrelated to risk preferences. Contrary to our expectations, counterfactual sensitivity was unrelated to hedonic capacity and trait anxiety. Nevertheless, trait anxiety was associated with a self-report measure of regret-proneness, suggesting that counterfactual influences may occur via a pathway that is separate from immediate counterfactual processing biases. Taken together, our results show that hedonic capacity but not trait anxiety affects risk-taking through a mechanism that appears independent of the shape of the subjective utility curve, while hedonic capacity and trait anxiety do not affect the influence of counterfactual outcomes on subjective utility. The results have implications for understanding the underlying mechanisms of variable decision-making and for developing interventions to improve decision-making.},

The number of fear subtypes (animals, natural environment, situational, blood--injection--injury or other type) has been shown to be associated with psychopathology. Furthermore, there is evidence suggesting that some subtypes may be more often associated with mental disorders than others. The present study uses data from a large cross sectional survey, the School Children Mental Health in Europe (SCMHE) study, conducted in eight European countries on children ages 6 through 13-years-old attending elementary school (n\,=\,9613). Fear subtypes and self-reported mental health were assessed using the Dominic Interactive (DI), a self-administered computerized image-based questionnaire. The findings show that the number of fear subtypes is strongly associated with self-reported internalizing and externalizing problems. In addition, adjusting for the number of subtypes, fear of animals was less likely than other fears to be associated with psychopathology. The findings support the notion that children who report excessive and generalized fear should be targeted for prevention, consistent with research identifying childhood onset generalized specific phobia as a probable precursor to subsequent psychopathology.},

  abstract = {There is an observed link between physical illness and mental health difficulties and an increased likelihood of mental health difficulties in young people with chronic health conditions. The main outcome focus in paediatric settings is on physical health outcomes and functioning. In terms of functioning, the focus is on quality of life, measures of emotional well-being and perceptions of personal change, which are likely to be multifaceted and vary between patients. To complement standardised and diagnostically based measures, goal-based outcome measurement may be considered. The aim of this paper is to build on previous research, to provide a reflective commentary based on the authors' clinical and research experience in the use and interpretation of goal-based outcomes, to address what using goal-based measures for outcome purposes in these settings means practically. Examples are provided to demonstrate the importance of considering meaningful outcomes of importance to young people and how professionals may presume that physical `recovery' is the goal of treatment, but what recovery means to that young person may be very nuanced. Further key considerations and suggested phrasing are given to introduce and work with young people's goals.},

  abstract = {Introduction:Personalised care requires personalised outcomes and ways of feeding back clinically useful information to clinicians and practitioners, but it is not clear how to best personalise outcome measurement and feedback using existing standardised outcome measures.Method:The constant comparison method of grounded theory was used to compare goal themes derived from goals set at the outset of therapy for 180 children aged between 4 and 17?years, visiting eight child and adolescent mental health services, to existing standardised outcome measures used as part of common national datasets.Results:In all, 20 out of 27 goal themes corresponded to items on at least one commonly used outcome measure.Discussion:Consideration of goal themes helped to identify potential relevant outcome measures. However, there were several goal themes that were not captured by items on standardised outcome measures. These seemed to be related to existential factors such as understanding, thinking about oneself and future planning.Conclusion:This presents a powerful framework for how clinicians can use goals to help select a standardised outcome measure (where this is helpful) in addition to the use of a goal-based outcome measure and personalise choices. There may be areas not captured by standardised outcome measures that may be important for children and young people and which may only be currently captured in goal measurement. There is an indication that we may not be measuring what is important to children and young people. We may need to develop or look for new measures that capture these areas.},

Theoretically, its effect is thought to rely on an interplay between activation and environmental reward. \textbf{\emph{Objective:}} The present systematic review examines the mediators of behavioural activation for depression. \textbf{\emph{Methods:}} A systematic literature search without time restrictions in Medline, EMBASE, PsycINFO, The Cochrane Library, and CINAHL resulted in 14 relevant controlled and uncontrolled prospective treatment studies that also performed formal mediation analyses to investigate their working mechanisms. After categorising the mediators investigated, we systematically compared the studies' methodological quality and performed a narrative synthesis of the findings. \textbf{\emph{Results:}} Most studies focused on activation or environmental reward, with 21 different mediators being investigated using questionnaires that focused on psychological processes or beliefs. The evidence for both activation and environmental reward as mediators was weak. \textbf{\emph{Conclusions:}} Non-significant results, poor methodological quality of some of the studies, and differences in questionnaires employed precluded any firm conclusions as to the significance of any of the mediators. Future research should exploit knowledge from fundamental research, such as reward motivation from neurobiology. Furthermore, the use of experience sampling methods and idiographic analyses in bigger samples is recommended to investigate potential causal pathways in individual patients.},

In this study, we explore the prevalence of social anxiety around the world using a self-report survey of 6,825 individuals (male = 3,342, female = 3,428, other = 55), aged 16--29 years (M = 22.84, SD = 3.97), from seven countries selected for their cultural and economic diversity: Brazil, China, Indonesia, Russia, Thailand, US, and Vietnam. The respondents completed the Social Interaction Anxiety Scale (SIAS). The global prevalence of social anxiety was found to be significantly higher than previously reported, with more than 1 in 3 (36\%) respondents meeting the threshold criteria for having Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD). Prevalence and severity of social anxiety symptoms did not differ between sexes but varied as a function of age, country, work status, level of education, and whether an individual lived in an urban or rural location. Additionally, 1 in 6 (18\%) perceived themselves as not having social anxiety, yet still met or exceeded the threshold for SAD. The data indicate that social anxiety is a concern for young adults around the world, many of whom do not recognise the difficulties they may experience. A large number of young people may be experiencing substantial disruptions in functioning and well-being which may be ameliorable with appropriate education and intervention.},

With summarizing evidence of 31 studies, this meta-analysis suggests that children with autism spectrum disorder have lower blood oxytocin levels compared to neurotypical individuals. This might not be the case for adults with autism spectrum disorder, where we could not find a difference. Our findings motivate further exploration of the oxytocin system in children with autism spectrum disorder. This could lead to therapeutic options in treating autism spectrum disorder in childhood.},

Understanding how adolescents interpret and learn from variable social signals can provide insight into the observed shift in social sensitivity during this period. The current study tested 120 participants between the ages of 8 and 25 years on a social reinforcement learning task where the probability of receiving positive social feedback was parametrically manipulated. Seventy-eight of these participants completed the task during fMRI scanning. Modeling trial-by-trial learning, children and adults showed higher positive learning rates than adolescents, suggesting that adolescents demonstrated less differentiation in their reaction times for peers who provided more positive feedback. Forming expectations about receiving positive social reinforcement correlated with neural activity within the medial prefrontal cortex and ventral striatum across age. Adolescents, unlike children and adults, showed greater insular activity during positive prediction error learning and increased activity in the supplementary motor cortex and the putamen when receiving positive social feedback regardless of the expected outcome, suggesting that peer approval may motivate adolescents towards action. While different amounts of positive social reinforcement enhanced learning in children and adults, all positive social reinforcement equally motivated adolescents. Together, these findings indicate that sensitivity to peer approval during adolescence goes beyond simple reinforcement theory accounts and suggests possible explanations for how peers may motivate adolescent behavior.},

Learning from positive social exchanges, such as acceptance from peers, may be similar to basic reinforcement learning. We formally test this hypothesis by developing a novel paradigm that is based on work in nonhuman primates and human imaging studies of reinforcement learning. The probability of receiving positive social reinforcement from three distinct peers was parametrically manipulated while brain activity was recorded in healthy adults using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging. Over the course of the experiment, participants responded more quickly to faces of peers who provided more frequent positive social reinforcement, and rated them as more likeable. Modeling trial-by-trial learning showed ventral striatum and orbital frontal cortex activity correlated positively with forming expectations about receiving social reinforcement. Rostral anterior cingulate cortex activity tracked positively with modulations of expected value of the cues (peers). Together, the findings across three levels of analysis---social preferences, response latencies, and modeling neural responses---are consistent with reinforcement learning theory and nonhuman primate electrophysiological studies of reward. This work highlights the fundamental influence of acceptance by one's peers in altering subsequent behavior.},

Studies 1 and 2 were correlational studies conducted on two different populations. In Study 1, we found that the extent to which Northern Irish Republicans and Unionists experienced shared negative experiences was associated with levels of identity fusion, and that this relationship was mediated by their reflection on these experiences. In Study 2, we replicated this finding among Bostonians, looking at their experiences of the 2013 Boston Marathon Bombings. These correlational studies provide initial evidence for the plausibility of our causal model; however, an experiment was required for a more direct test. Thus, in Study 3, we experimentally manipulated the salience of the Boston Marathon Bombings, and found that this increased state levels of identity fusion among those who experienced it negatively. Taken together, these three studies provide evidence that shared negative experience leads to identity fusion, and that this process involves personal reflection.},

Many of these illnesses have substantial sex differences in prevalence, suggesting that sex differences in brain development may underlie differential risk for psychiatric symptoms between males and females. Substantial evidence documents sex differences in brain structure and function in adults, and accumulating data suggests that these sex differences may be present or emerge during development. Here we review the evidence for sex differences in brain structure, white matter organization, and perfusion during development. We then use these normative differences as a framework to understand sex differences in brain development associated with psychopathology. In particular, we focus on sex differences in the brain as they relate to anxiety, depression, psychosis, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity symptoms. Finally, we highlight existing limitations, gaps in knowledge, and fertile avenues for future research.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The stepped-care approach, where people with early symptoms of depression are stepped up from low-intensity interventions to higher-level interventions as needed, has the potential to assist many people with mild depressive symptoms. Self-monitoring techniques assist people to understand their mental health symptoms by increasing their emotional self-awareness (ESA) and can be easily distributed on mobile phones at low cost. Increasing ESA is an important first step in psychotherapy and has the potential to intervene before mild depressive symptoms progress to major depressive disorder. In this secondary analysis we examined a mobile phone self-monitoring tool used by young people experiencing mild or more depressive symptoms to investigate the relationships between self-monitoring, ESA, and depression. OBJECTIVES: We tested two main hypotheses: (1) people who monitored their mood, stress, and coping strategies would have increased ESA from pretest to 6-week follow-up compared with an attention comparison group, and (2) an increase in ESA would predict a decrease in depressive symptoms. METHODS: We recruited patients aged 14 to 24 years from rural and metropolitan general practices. Eligible participants were identified as having mild or more mental health concerns by their general practitioner. Participants were randomly assigned to either the intervention group (where mood, stress, and daily activities were monitored) or the attention comparison group (where only daily activities were monitored), and both groups self-monitored for 2 to 4 weeks. Randomization was carried out electronically via random seed generation, by an in-house computer programmer; therefore, general practitioners, participants, and researchers were blinded to group allocation at randomization. Participants completed pretest, posttest, and 6-week follow-up measures of the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale and the ESA Scale. We estimated a parallel process latent growth curve model (LGCM) using Mplus to test the indirect effect of the intervention on depressive symptoms via the mediator ESA, and calculated 95\% bias-corrected bootstrapping confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Of the 163 participants assessed for eligibility, 118 were randomly assigned and 114 were included in analyses (68 in the intervention group and 46 in the comparison group). A parallel process LGCM estimated the indirect effect of the intervention on depressive symptoms via ESA and was shown to be statistically significant based on the 95\% bias-corrected bootstrapping CIs not containing zero (-6.366 to -0.029). The proportion of the maximum possible indirect effect estimated was {$\kappa$}(2 )=.54 (95\% CI .426-.640). CONCLUSIONS: This study supported the hypothesis that self-monitoring increases ESA, which in turn decreases depressive symptoms for young people with mild or more depressive symptoms. Mobile phone self-monitoring programs are ideally suited to first-step intervention programs for depression in the stepped-care approach, particularly when ESA is targeted as a mediating factor.

METHOD: Subjects were 55 psychiatric outpatients and 11 normal controls (aged 7 through 17 years). Both parents and children were used as informants. Concurrent validity of the screen criteria and the K-SADS-PL diagnoses was assessed against standard self-report scales. Interrater (n = 15) and test-retest (n = 20) reliability data were also collected (mean retest interval: 18 days; range: 2 to 36 days). RESULTS: Rating scale data support the concurrent validity of screens and K-SADS-PL diagnoses. Interrater agreement in scoring screens and diagnoses was high (range: 93\% to 100\%). Test-retest reliability kappa coefficients were in the excellent range for present and/or lifetime diagnoses of major depression, any bipolar, generalized anxiety, conduct, and oppositional defiant disorder (.77 to 1.00) and in the good range for present diagnoses of posttraumatic stress disorder and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (.63 to .67). CONCLUSION: Results suggest the K-SADS-PL generates reliable and valid child psychiatric diagnoses.},

  abstract = {A strong association between sleep problems and suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs) has been demonstrated in high-income countries. The sleep-STB relationship, however, is minimally understood among youth in low and middle-incomes countries. There also is a limited understanding of how individual- (i.e., age, sex) and country-level (i.e., economic inequality, economic quality) factors may moderate the magnitude of the sleep-STB association among youth. Data were analyzed from the cross-national Global School-based Health Survey 2003-2017, which assessed a range of health behaviors among school-enrolled adolescents aged 11-18~years from 88 low-, lower-middle, upper-middle, and high-income countries. Multilevel models were used to examine the influence of individual- and country-level factors on the association between past-year worry-related sleep problems and past-year suicide ideation, suicide plans, and suicide attempts. Worry-related sleep problems were significantly associated with suicide ideation, plans, and attempts. Adolescent sex, country economic quality (income group designation), and country economic inequality moderated the sleep-STB association, but age did not. The sleep-STB relationship was stronger for males and across macroeconomic indices, the relationship was generally strongest among upper-middle income countries (economic quality) and countries with a big income gap (economic inequality). When examining how individual-level factors differentially affected the sleep-STB relationship within economic quality (income group designation), the effects were driven by older adolescents in high-income countries for suicide ideation and suicide plans. Study findings suggest an important role for global macroeconomic factors, for males, and older adolescents in high-income countries in the sleep-STB relationship. Future directions include expanding worldwide coverage of countries, assessing a wider range of sleep problems, and longitudinal work to understand potential mechanisms in the sleep-STB relationship.},

  abstract = {Attention is the gate through which sensory information enters our conscious experiences. Oftentimes, patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) complain of concentration difficulties that negatively impact their day-to-day function, and these attention problems are not alleviated by current first-line treatments. In spite of attention's influence on many aspects of cognitive and emotional functioning, and the inclusion of concentration difficulties in the diagnostic criteria for MDD, the focus of depression as a disease is typically on mood features, with attentional features considered less of an imperative for investigation. Here, we summarize the breadth and depth of findings from the cognitive neurosciences regarding the neural mechanisms supporting goal-directed attention in order to better understand how these might go awry in depression. First, we characterize behavioral impairments in selective, sustained, and divided attention in depressed individuals. We then discuss interactions between goal-directed attention and other aspects of cognition (cognitive control, perception, and decision-making) and emotional functioning (negative biases, internally-focused attention, and interactions of mood and attention). We then review evidence for neurobiological mechanisms supporting attention, including the organization of large-scale neural networks and electrophysiological synchrony. Finally, we discuss the failure of current first-line treatments to alleviate attention impairments in MDD and review evidence for more targeted pharmacological, brain stimulation, and behavioral interventions. By synthesizing findings across disciplines and delineating avenues for future research, we aim to provide a clearer outline of how attention impairments may arise in the context of MDD and how, mechanistically, they may negatively impact daily functioning across various domains.},

With early roots in behaviorism (see Benjamin et al., 2011), CBT bas evolved into an integrative approach with developmental, social, family, and of course cognitive and behavioral influences. In many ways, the results of research evaluations and clinical applications have guided the emergence of today's CBT. With widespread application and favorable research evaluations, CBT merits its status as an empirically supported treatment. Several CBT strategies are applicable transdiagnostically: they can be tailored to target underlying mechanisms that are disorder specific or shared across disorders. Let's consider a few of the CBT strategies to illustrate their transdiagnostic application. A central aspect of CBT that crosses disorders is the use of psychoeducation to help the youth understand the connection between thoughts, feelings, and actions. The therapist would be able to use the "triangle" heuristic across disorders in order to help the child understand the reciprocal relationship between thoughts, emotions, and behavior and how cognitive-behavioral treatment strategies can be used to intervene at points on the triangle. However, the information provided about the nature and impact of the disorder would be disorder specific. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {A foundational question for the discipline of psychiatry is the nature of psychiatric disorders. What kinds of things are they? In this paper, I review and critique three major relevant theories: realism, pragmatism and constructivism. Realism assumes that the content of science is real and independent of human activities. I distinguish two "flavors" of realism: chemistry-based, for which the paradigmatic example is elements of the periodic table, and biology-based, for which the paradigm is species. The latter is a much better fit for psychiatry. Pragmatism articulates a sensible approach to psychiatric disorders just seeking categories that perform well in the world. But it makes no claim about the reality of those disorders. This is problematic, because we have a duty to advocate for our profession and our patients against other physicians who never doubt the reality of the disorders they treat. Constructivism has been associated with anti-psychiatry activists, but we should admit that social forces play a role in the creation of our diagnoses, as they do in many sciences. However, truly socially constructed psychiatric disorders are rare. I then describe powerful arguments against a realist theory of psychiatric disorders. Because so many prior psychiatric diagnoses have been proposed and then abandoned, can we really claim that our current nosologies have it right? Much of our current nosology arose from a series of historical figures and events which could have gone differently. If we re-run the tape of history over and over again, the DSM and ICD would not likely have the same categories on every iteration. Therefore, we should argue more confidently for the reality of broader constructs of psychiatric illness rather than our current diagnostic categories, which remain tentative. Finally, instead of thinking that our disorders are true because they correspond to clear entities in the world, we should consider a coherence theory of truth by which disorders become more true when they fit better into what else we know about the world. In our ongoing project to study and justify the nature of psychiatric disorders, we ought to be broadly pragmatic but not lose sight of an underlying commitment, despite the associated difficulties, to the reality of psychiatric illness.},

RESULTS: Analysis of fMRI studies revealed significantly reduced striatal activation in depressed compared with healthy individuals during reward feedback. When region-of-interest analyses were included, reduced activation was also observed in reward anticipation, an effect that was stronger in individuals under age 18. FRN was also significantly reduced in depression, with pronounced effects in individuals under age 18. In longitudinal studies, reduced striatal activation in fMRI and blunted FRN in EEG were found to precede the onset of depression in adolescents.

Theoretical accounts suggest that when reporting on our mood we integrate over the history of our experiences; yet, the temporal structure of this integration remains unexamined. Here, we use a computational approach to quantitatively answer this question and show that early events exert a stronger influence on reported mood (a primacy weighting) compared to recent events. We show that a Primacy model accounts better for mood reports compared to a range of alternative temporal representations across random, consistent, or dynamic reward environments, different age groups, and in both healthy and depressed participants. Moreover, we find evidence for neural encoding of the Primacy, but not the Recency, model in frontal brain regions related to mood regulation. These findings hold implications for the timing of events in experimental or clinical settings and suggest new directions for individualized mood interventions.},

Only limited data of this sort are available.To present estimates of 12-month and 30-day prevalence, persistence (12-month prevalence among lifetime cases and 30-day prevalence among 12-month cases), and sociodemographic correlates of commonly occurring DSM-IV disorders among adolescents in the National Comorbidity Survey Replication Adolescent Supplement.The National Comorbidity Survey Replication Adolescent Supplement is a US national survey of DSM-IV anxiety, mood, behavior, and substance disorders among US adolescents based on face-to-face interviews in the homes of respondents with supplemental parent questionnaires.Dual-frame household and school samples of US adolescents.A total of 10~148 adolescents aged 13 to 17 years (interviews) and 1 parent of each adolescent (questionnaires).The DSM-IV disorders assessed with the World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview and validated with blinded clinical interviews based on the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children. Good concordance (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve {$\geq$}0.80) was found between Composite International Diagnostic Interview and Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children diagnoses.The prevalence estimates of any DSM-IV disorder are 40.3\% at 12 months (79.5\% of lifetime cases) and 23.4\% at 30 days (57.9\% of 12-month cases). Anxiety disorders are the most common class of disorders, followed by behavior, mood, and substance disorders. Although relative disorder prevalence is quite stable over time, 30-day to 12-month prevalence ratios are higher for anxiety and behavior disorders than mood or substance disorders, suggesting that the former are more chronic than the latter. The 30-day to 12-month prevalence ratios are generally lower than the 12-month to lifetime ratios, suggesting that disorder persistence is due more to episode recurrence than to chronicity. Sociodemographic correlates are largely consistent with previous studies.Among US adolescents, DSM-IV disorders are highly prevalent and persistent. Persistence is higher for adolescents than among adults and appears to be due more to recurrence than chronicity of child-adolescent onset disorders.},

Children who lose a parent are at elevated risk of traumatic grief, depression, poor educational outcomes, and unintentional death or suicide, and these consequences can persist into adulthood. Sudden parental death, such as that occurring owing to COVID-19, can be particularly traumatizing for children and leave families ill prepared to navigate its consequences. Moreover, COVID-19 losses are occurring at a time of social isolation, institutional strain, and economic hardship, potentially leaving bereaved children without the supports they need.},

  abstract = {Purpose of review Chronic, severe irritability is a common presenting problem in children and adolescents. Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD) was added to the DSM-5 in recognition of this public health need. Currently there are no well-established, evidence-based pharmacological or psychosocial treatments specifically for DMDD. Here, we focus on psychosocial interventions. In addition to reviewing published research, we present preliminary, open trial data on a novel exposure-based cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) targeting severe irritability, as is present in DMDD. Recent findings In the published literature, parent management training (PMT) comprises parent-based interventions designed to treat youth disruptive behavior. Child-based interventions for disruptive behavior include CBT focused on social cognition and problem-solving. Based on identified treatment gaps for severe irritability in children and adolescents, novel psychosocial interventions are being developed. We have developed a CBT for severe irritability that integrates exposure techniques, drawn from anxiety treatment, with selected PMT techniques. Data from an open pilot trial (N=10) suggest feasibility. Summary Promising psychosocial treatments are being developed for DMDD. Future directions include testing these new therapies against extant interventions. Increased research on the biological and psychological mechanisms mediating irritability will further bridge the treatment gap for youth and families.},

Participants in Study 1 were 54 adults who had attempted suicide in the previous year and completed 28 days of ecological momentary assessment (EMA; average of 2.51 assessments per day; 2,891 unique assessments). Participants in Study 2 were 36 adult psychiatric inpatients admitted for suicide risk who completed EMA throughout their time in the hospital (average stay of 10.32 days; average 2.48 assessments per day; 649 unique assessments). These studies revealed 2 key findings: (a) For nearly all participants, suicidal ideation varied dramatically over the course of most days: more than 1-quarter (Study 1 = 29\%; Study 2 = 28\%) of all ratings of suicidal ideation were a standard deviation above or below the previous response from a few hours earlier and nearly all (Study 1 = 94.1\%; Study 2 = 100\%) participants had at least 1 instance of intensity of suicidal ideation changing by a standard deviation or more from 1 response to the next. (b) Across both studies, well-known risk factors for suicidal ideation such as hopelessness, burdensomeness, and loneliness also varied considerably over just a few hours and correlated with suicidal ideation, but were limited in predicting short-term change in suicidal ideation. These studies represent the most fine-grained examination of suicidal ideation ever conducted. The results advance the understanding of how suicidal ideation changes over short periods and provide a novel method of improving the short-term prediction of suicidal ideation.

A secondary aim of this article is to show how the same instrument can sometimes be adapted to fit different theoretical approaches or to focus on different dimensions of school climate.Design and methods: After database consultation and literature hand searching, the resulting literature was screened for a statistical analysis of school climate and aggression. Those studies that had unclear operationalisations of the main variables or used qualitative methods were excluded. The resulting selection of studies were further scanned for common instruments used to evaluate school climate.Conclusions: This article will show how the California School Climate Survey (CSCS), the Psychological Sense of School Membership Scale (PSSM), the School Climate Survey (SCS) and the Effective School Battery (ESB) as well as different versions of self-created scales on school connectedness, school climate and school culture have been adapted by different researchers in different contexts. Finally, the necessity of adapting a pre-existing instrument or creating a new one will be discussed.},

  abstract = {Increased serum levels of inflammatory mediators have been associated with numerous disease states including atherosclerosis, Type II diabetes, hypertension, depression, and overall mortality. We hypothesized that a long-term exercise intervention among older adults would reduce serum inflammatory cytokines, and this reduction would be mediated, in part, by improvements in psychosocial factors and/or by beta-adrenergic receptor mechanisms. Adults age 64 were randomly assigned to either an aerobic exercise treatment (CARDIO) or a flexibility/strength exercise treatment (FLEX) 3 days/week, 45 min/day for 10 months. A subgroup of subjects treated with non-selective beta(1)beta(2) adrenergic antagonists were included to evaluate the potential role of beta-adrenergic receptor adaptations as mediators of an exercise-induced change in inflammation. The inflammatory mediators [C-reactive protein (CRP), IL-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and IL-18] and the psychosocial factors (depression, perceived stress, optimism, sense of coherence, and social support) were measured pre- and post-intervention. The CARDIO treatment resulted in significant reductions in serum CRP, IL-6, and IL-18 compared to the FLEX treatment (significant treatment x time interaction, p{$<$}.05), whereas TNFalpha declined in both groups (main effect of time, p=.001). However, several psychosocial factors (depression, optimism, and sense of coherence) improved in both groups suggesting that the reduction of CRP, IL-6, and IL-18 in the CARDIO group was not mediated by improvements in psychosocial scores. With respect to the potential role of beta-adrenergic receptors, both CARDIO subjects treated with beta-adrenergic antagonists and those who were not treated with those medications demonstrated similar reductions in serum CRP, IL-6, IL-18, and TNFalpha. In summary, we have observed that an aerobic exercise intervention can significantly reduce serum inflammatory mediators, but beta-adrenergic receptors and psychosocial factors do not appear to be involved.},

Regular use of tobacco, alcohol, and illicit drugs was more common in males, while unprescribed use of licit psychotropic drugs prevailed in females. Regular smoking, drinking, and illicit drug use were associated with urbanization but not socioeconomic status. Between 1984 and 1988 in an Athenian subsample of schools there was a 20 percent increase in illicit drug use among males.

This prospective study aimed to investigate the bidirectional effect of chronic pain and internalizing problems and test the persistence of pain over time in a population-based sample of preschoolers. The study was embedded in Generation R, a large population-based cohort. Mothers of 3,996 children assessed their child's experienced pain and internalizing problems at 3 and 6~years. At 3~years, paternal reports were available too. Reports of family functioning, discipline practices and parental psychopathology were also collected. The prevalence of chronic pain was 2.7\% (106) and 8.0\% (294) at baseline and follow-up, respectively. The presence of internalizing problems at child age 3~years predicted chronic pain at 6 years, for both maternal (OR 1.05, 95\% CI 1.02,1.07, p\,{$<$}\,0.001) and paternal (OR 1.03, 95\%CI 1.00, 1.06, p\,{$<$}\,0.05) internalizing problem reports, when adjusted for potential confounding factors. In contrast, chronic pain did not increase the likelihood of internalizing problems. The temporal relationship between chronic pain and internalizing problems appears to follow a largely unidirectional trend in early childhood, with internalizing problems increasing the likelihood of concurrent physical symptoms. Current understanding of the directionality of this relationship, highlights the importance for comprehensive assessment of psychiatric problems contributing to the manifestation of chronic pain.},

Adolescents had been allocated to Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy, Short-Term Psychoanalytic Psychotherapy, or a Brief Psychosocial Intervention.The study mapped seven high-level outcome domains and 29 outcome categories. On average, participants discussed change in four domains and six outcome categories. The most frequently discussed outcome was an improvement in mood and affect (i.e., core depressive symptoms), but close to half of the participants also described changes in family functioning, coping and resilience, academic functioning, or social functioning. Coping had specific importance for adolescents, while parents and therapists showed particular interest in academic functioning. There was some variation in the outcomes discussed beyond these core themes, across stakeholder groups and treatment arms.Of the outcomes that were frequently discussed in stakeholder narratives, only symptomatic change has been commonly reported in recent treatment studies for adolescent depression. A shift towards considering multiple outcome domains and perspectives is needed to reflect stakeholder priorities and enable more nuanced insights into change processes.},

  abstract = {A major barrier to improving care effectiveness for mental health is a lack of consensus on outcomes measurement. The International Consortium for Health Outcomes Measurement (ICHOM) has already developed a consensus-based standard set of outcomes for anxiety and depression in adults (including the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, the Generalised Anxiety Disorder 7-item Scale, and the WHO Disability Schedule). This Position Paper reports on recommendations specifically for anxiety, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder in children and young people aged between 6 and 24 years. An international ICHOM working group of 27 clinical, research, and lived experience experts formed a consensus through teleconferences, an exercise using an adapted Delphi technique (a method for reaching group consensus), and iterative anonymous voting, supported by sequential research inputs. A systematic scoping review identified 70 possible outcomes and 107 relevant measurement instruments. Measures were appraised for their feasibility in routine practice (ie, brevity, free availability, validation in children and young people, and language translation) and psychometric performance (ie, validity, reliability, and sensitivity to change). The final standard set recommends tracking symptoms, suicidal thoughts and behaviour, and functioning as a minimum through seven primarily patient-reported outcome measures: the Revised Children's Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Obsessive Compulsive Inventory for Children, the Children's Revised Impact of Events Scale, the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale, the KIDSCREEN-10, the Children's Global Assessment Scale, and the Child Anxiety Life Interference Scale. The set's recommendations were validated through a feedback survey involving 487 participants across 45 countries. The set should be used alongside the anxiety and depression standard set for adults with clinicians selecting age-appropriate measures.},

The disorder generally starts in adolescence, but often goes unnoticed and is severely underdiagnosed. Left untreated, BDD typically persists and causes marked functional impairment in multiple domains. This clinical review considers recent advances in the epidemiology and classification of BDD, including its reclassification in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders under the new 'Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders' chapter. Key issues in assessment are outlined including the use of validated screening instruments to minimise misdiagnosis and the importance of risk assessment in this population given the high rates of suicidality and inappropriate use of cosmetic treatments. In addition, current knowledge regarding the causes and mechanisms underlying BDD are summarised. The recommended treatments for BDD are outlined, namely cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and antidepressants, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Both CBT and pharmacotherapy have been shown to be efficacious treatments for BDD in adult populations, and evidence is emerging to support their use in young people. Although the majority of patients improve with existing evidence-based treatment, a large proportion are left with clinically significant residual symptoms. Priorities for future research are therefore discussed including the need to further refine and evaluate existing interventions with the goal of improving treatment outcomes and to increase their availability.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: While considerable attention has focused on improving the detection of depression, assessment of severity is also important in guiding treatment decisions. Therefore, we examined the validity of a brief, new measure of depression severity. MEASUREMENTS: The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) is a self-administered version of the PRIME-MD diagnostic instrument for common mental disorders. The PHQ-9 is the depression module, which scores each of the 9 DSM-IV criteria as "0" (not at all) to "3" (nearly every day). The PHQ-9 was completed by 6,000 patients in 8 primary care clinics and 7 obstetrics-gynecology clinics. Construct validity was assessed using the 20-item Short-Form General Health Survey, self-reported sick days and clinic visits, and symptom-related difficulty. Criterion validity was assessed against an independent structured mental health professional (MHP) interview in a sample of 580 patients. RESULTS: As PHQ-9 depression severity increased, there was a substantial decrease in functional status on all 6 SF-20 subscales. Also, symptom-related difficulty, sick days, and health care utilization increased. Using the MHP reinterview as the criterion standard, a PHQ-9 score {$>$} or =10 had a sensitivity of 88\% and a specificity of 88\% for major depression. PHQ-9 scores of 5, 10, 15, and 20 represented mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe depression, respectively. Results were similar in the primary care and obstetrics-gynecology samples. CONCLUSION: In addition to making criteria-based diagnoses of depressive disorders, the PHQ-9 is also a reliable and valid measure of depression severity. These characteristics plus its brevity make the PHQ-9 a useful clinical and research tool.},

  abstract = {Background: Research has shown that negative expectations in major depressive disorder (MDD) often persist despite positive disconfirming experiences. To explain this phenomenon, the concept of cognitive immunization has been introduced: that is, individuals with MDD reappraise disconfirming positive evidence in such a way that negative expectations are maintained. In this study, we examined whether it is possible to inhibit cognitive immunization to facilitate expectation update. Methods: We examined 113 people with MDD being treated in an inpatient psychosomatic hospital. Using a previously validated paradigm, participants worked on a standardized performance test; we examined changes in negative performance-related expectations after positive expectation-disconfirming feedback. One experimental group received additional information increasing the value of the positive feedback (`INFORMATION'). Another group was instructed to recall the feedback after completing the task (`RECALL'). In a third group, participants' attention was shifted to potential expectation-disconfirming feedback (`ATTENTION'). In addition, a control group underwent the standard procedure of the paradigm. Results: The results showed significant group differences in the change in generalized performance expectations, with the largest changes in participants from the INFORMATION group. All experimental groups had lower values for cognitive immunization than the control group. Limitations: Given that this proof-of-concept study was the first to examine strategies to inhibit cognitive immunization, the findings need to be replicated in future studies. Conclusions: The present study confirms that cognitive immunization in MDD can be inhibited, thus facilitating adjusting negative expectations. The most promising results were found for the INFORMATION group, providing information to emphasize the relevance of expectation-disconfirming information.},

In order to measure expressions of emotion, facial Electromyography (EMG) has widely been used, requiring electrodes and technical equipment. More recently, emotion recognition software has been developed that detects emotions from video recordings of human faces. However, its validity and comparability to EMG measures is unclear. The aim of the current study was to compare the Affectiva Affdex emotion recognition software by iMotions with EMG measurements of the zygomaticus mayor and corrugator supercilii muscle, concerning its ability to identify happy, angry and neutral faces. Twenty participants imitated these facial expressions while videos and EMG were recorded. Happy and angry expressions were detected by both the software and by EMG above chance, while neutral expressions were more often falsely identified as negative by EMG compared to the software. Overall, EMG and software values correlated highly. In conclusion, Affectiva Affdex software can identify facial expressions and its results are comparable to EMG findings.},

  abstract = {Adolescents strive for peer approval, and an increased sensitivity to peers' opinions is normative. However, among vulnerable adolescents, peer evaluation can be detrimental, contributing to affective disorders. It is, therefore, critical to improve our understanding of neural underpinnings of peer evaluation. Prior research has investigated averaged neural responses to peer acceptance or rejection, neglecting to probe trial-by-trial computations that mirror real-time updating of daily activities. In non-social decision-making, a common neural valuation system centered on the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) has emerged, which evaluates different reward types on a common scale to guide choices. However, it is unclear whether the mPFC also tracks complex social scenarios involving peer feedback. To address this gap, we acquired fMRI data from 55 healthy adolescents during the Chatroom Task, which probes peer evaluation, and implemented a computational approach to characterize trial-by-trial social value, thereby allowing us to interrogate the neural correlates of social value. Consistent with our hypothesis, social value signals were encoded in the mPFC. Interestingly, analyses also revealed a wider social-specific valuation network including the precuneus and amygdala. Understanding how adolescents make social decisions and neural markers associated with it, may, ultimately, help us clarify promising targets for intervention.},

We then argue that testimonial and hermeneutic injustices also affect individuals with mental disorders not only when communicating with their caregivers but also in the social context as they attempt to reintegrate into the general society and assume responsibilities as productive citizens. Following the trend of the movement of mental health care to the community, the testimonies of people with mental disorders should not be restricted to issues involving their own personal mental states.},

This article aims to provide a practical primer on how to calculate and report effect sizes for t-tests and ANOVA's such that effect sizes can be used in a-priori power analyses and meta-analyses. Whereas many articles about effect sizes focus on between-subjects designs and address within-subjects designs only briefly, I provide a detailed overview of the similarities and differences between within- and between-subjects designs. I suggest that some research questions in experimental psychology examine inherently intra-individual effects, which makes effect sizes that incorporate the correlation between measures the best summary of the results.

A widely recommended approach within a frequentist framework is to test for equivalence. In equivalence tests, such as the two one-sided tests (TOST) procedure discussed in this article, an upper and lower equivalence bound is specified based on the smallest effect size of interest. The TOST procedure can be used to statistically reject the presence of effects large enough to be considered worthwhile. This practical primer with accompanying spreadsheet and R package enables psychologists to easily perform equivalence tests (and power analyses) by setting equivalence bounds based on standardized effect sizes and provides recommendations to prespecify equivalence bounds. Extending your statistical tool kit with equivalence tests is an easy way to improve your statistical and theoretical inferences.},

METHOD: Parents of preschoolers completed both a SWAN and the well-established Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) on two separate occasions over a span of 3 months; instruments were in the primary language of the family (English or Spanish). RESULTS: Psychometric properties for the English and Spanish versions of the SWAN were adequate, with high internal consistency and moderate test-retest reliability. Skewness and kurtosis statistics for the SWAN were within the range expected for a normally distributed population. The SWAN also demonstrated adequate convergent and discriminant validity in correlations with the various subscales of the SDQ. CONCLUSION: Psychometric properties of both the English and Spanish versions of the SWAN indicate that it is a reliable and valid instrument for measuring child attention and hyperactivity. The stability of ratings over time in this preschool sample was moderate, which may reflect the relative instability of these characteristics in preschool children.},

  abstract = {Human speech expresses emotional meaning not only through semantics, but also through certain attributes of the voice, such as pitch or loudness. In investigations of vocal emotion recognition, there is considerable variability in the types of stimuli and procedures used to examine their influence on emotion recognition. In addition, accurate metacognition was argued to promote correct and confident interpretations in emotion recognition tasks. Nevertheless, such associations have rarely been studied previously. We addressed this gap by examining the impact of vocal stimulus type and prosodic speech attributes on emotion recognition and a person's confidence in a given response. We analysed a total of 1038 emotional expressions according to a baseline set of 13 prosodic acoustic parameters. Results showed that these parameters provided sufficient discrimination between expressions of emotional categories to permit accurate statistical classification. Emotion recognition and confidence judgments were found to depend on stimulus material as they could be reliably predicted by different constellations of acoustic features. Finally, results indicated that listeners' accuracy and confidence judgements were significantly higher for affect bursts than speech-embedded stimuli and that the correct classification of emotional expressions elicited increased confidence judgements. Together, these findings show that vocal stimulus type and prosodic attributes of speech strongly influence emotion recognition and listeners' confidence in these given responses.},

  abstract = {Incidents of road rage are frequently reported in the media, yet despite claims that aggression on congested roads is a serious social problem, little empirical research has explored the question of whether people really do become more aggressive behind the wheel. This study compares levels and expression of anger in everyday and driving situations with the aim of testing some of the commonly held beliefs about aggression on the roads. A survey questionnaire presented 15 short scenarios describing frustrating situations and included a measure of anger and three levels of expression, outward, displaced, and suppressed. The questionnaire was posted on the Internet and received 226 responses during a 3-month period. Analysis revealed that people were no more likely to report experiencing anger while driving than in non-driving situations. However, the expression of anger did differ in the two contexts. In response to the driving scenarios, respondents were significantly more likely to report displacing their anger than in non-driving situations. Those individuals who reported high levels of anger were also more likely to be outwardly aggressive while driving than they were in non-driving situations. Although males and females reported very similar levels of anger, their expression of anger did differ. For females, the largest difference is between outwardly expressing anger and the other two forms, displacing and suppressing, whereas for men, the differences between these three forms are more alike. The paper concludes with a discussion of the practical implications of these findings.},

Cognitive Therapy for Social Anxiety Disorder (CT-SAD) in adults is a well-established treatment that shows strong evidence of differential effectiveness when compared to other active treatments. In contrast, CBT approaches to social anxiety in young people have yet to demonstrate differential effectiveness and there is some evidence that young people with social anxiety disorder respond less well than those with other anxiety disorders. AIMS: To adapt CT-SAD for use with adolescents and conduct a pilot case series. METHOD: Five adolescents, aged 11-17 years, with a primary DSM-5 diagnosis of social anxiety disorder received a course of CT-SAD adapted for adolescents. Standardized clinical interview and questionnaire assessments were conducted at pre and posttreatment, and 2 to 3-month follow-up. RESULTS: All five participants reported severe social anxiety at baseline and achieved remission by the end of treatment. Significant improvements were also observed in general anxiety, depression, concentration in the classroom, and putative process measures (social anxiety related thoughts, beliefs and safety behaviours).

  abstract = {Background The identification of negative self-imagery as a maintenance factor in adult social anxiety has led to enhanced treatments for this population. Whilst intrusive negative imagery is commonly reported by socially anxious adolescents, no studies have demonstrated that it plays a causal role in maintaining symptoms. To assess this possibility, we undertook an experimental study manipulating social self-imagery in high socially anxious adolescents. Methods High socially anxious adolescents undertook two conversations under different conditions. During one conversation they held a negative social self-image in mind, and in the other they held a benign social self-image in mind. Self-report, conversation partner report and independent assessor ratings were taken. Results When participants held a negative self-image in mind, they reported feeling more anxious, and believed they looked more anxious and performed more poorly. Furthermore, they overestimated how anxious they looked compared to conversation partner ratings. As well as distorting participants' perception of their anxious appearance, holding a negative image in mind also had observable effects on the interaction. Participants were rated as looking more anxious and performing less well by their conversation partner when they held such images in mind, and the conversation was rated more critically by conversation partners and independent observers. Finally, a preliminary mediation analysis suggested that the detrimental effect of negative imagery on the social interaction may be partly due to the spontaneous use of avoidant safety behaviours. Conclusions The findings provide support for a causal role of negative self-imagery in adolescent social anxiety and point to the potential clinical value of techniques targeting imagery to treat the disorder.},

However, the high prevalence of adolescent SAD and limited number of therapists presents an implementation challenge. Delivery of CT-SAD via the Internet may offer part of the solution. METHOD: Forty-three youth (14-18\,years) with SAD recruited through schools were randomly allocated to therapist-assisted Internet-delivered CT-SAD (called OSCA) or waitlist for 14\,weeks (ISRCTN15079139). RESULTS: OSCA outperformed waitlist on all measures and was associated with large effects that were maintained at 6-month follow-up. In the OSCA arm, 77\% of adolescents lost their SAD diagnosis at post (vs. 14\% in the waitlist arm), increasing to 91\% at 6-months. Beneficial effects of OSCA were mediated through changes in cognitions and safety behaviours as predicted by cognitive models of SAD. OSCA was associated with high credibility and therapeutic alliance. CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary trial suggests OSCA holds promise as an effective, accessible treatment for adolescent SAD. Future definitive trials could compare OSCA to active comparators to examine specificity of effects.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Adolescent social anxiety disorder (SAD) is common, impairing and persistent. There is a need to intervene early to avert its long-term consequences. Cognitive Therapy for SAD is the leading treatment for adults and shows promise for adolescents. However, given the scale of the problem of adolescent SAD and the limited availability of psychological therapists in child and adolescent mental health services, there is a substantial gap in service provision. Delivering therapy via the Internet may provide part of the solution to this problem. An Internet version of adult Cognitive Therapy for SAD has been developed, with outcomes similar to face-to-face therapy. We have recently adapted this treatment for use with adolescents with SAD. Here, we describe a randomised controlled trial designed to test the efficacy of Internet Cognitive Therapy for adolescent SAD compared to waitlist. METHODS/DESIGN: Forty adolescents aged 14-18\,years with a diagnosis of SAD will be recruited via schools. Participants will be randomly allocated to Internet Cognitive Therapy or to waitlist. All participants will be assessed three times during the study-at baseline (pretreatment/wait), midtreatment/wait (week 8) and posttreatment/wait (week 15). Participants in the experimental arm will also complete weekly measures as part of the online program and they will be assessed at 3 and 6\,months. Postwait, participants in the waitlist arm will be offered Internet Cognitive Therapy, and weekly and posttreatment data will also be collected for them. The trial aims to test whether Internet Cognitive Therapy is superior to waitlist in reducing social anxiety symptoms and in reducing the proportion of adolescents meeting criteria for SAD. Other outcomes of interest include depression and general anxiety symptoms. Acceptability of the online treatment will also be evaluated. DISCUSSION: This randomised controlled trial will provide preliminary evidence on whether this intervention, requiring relatively low levels of therapist input, is safe and clinically effective. If this is shown to be the case, Internet Cognitive Therapy for adolescents has the potential to provide a service to the large population of adolescents with untreated SAD.

METHODS: This experiment explored this possibility by asking high and low socially anxious adolescents (N = 57) to undertake conversations under different conditions. During one conversation they were instructed to focus on themselves and use safety behaviours, and in the other they focused externally and did not use safety behaviours. Self-report, conversation partner report and independent assessor ratings were taken. RESULTS: Self-focus and safety behaviours increased feelings and appearance of anxiety and undermined performance for all participants, but only high socially anxious participants reported habitually using self-focus and safety behaviours. CONCLUSIONS: The findings provide support for the causal role of self-focus and safety behaviours in adolescent social anxiety and point to the potential clinical value of techniques reversing them to treat the disorder.},

  abstract = {Social anxiety disorder is a condition characterised by a marked and persistent fear of being humiliated or scrutinised by others. Age-of-onset data point to adolescence as a developmentally sensitive period for the emergence of the condition, at a time when the peer group becomes increasingly important. Social anxiety in adolescence is associated with considerable impairment that persists through to adulthood. There are clear potential benefits to delivering effective interventions during adolescence. However, there is limited evidence on the specific efficacy of available therapies. This is in contrast to adults, for whom we have interventions with very specific treatment effects. One such treatment is individual cognitive therapy. Cognitive therapy is based on the cognitive model of social anxiety proposed by Clark and Wells (in: Heimberg, Leibowitz, Hope, Scheiber (eds) Social phobia: diagnosis, assessment and treatment, The Guilford Press, New York, 1995). The present review examines the potential application of this adult cognitive model to the understanding of adolescent social anxiety and considers additional adolescent-specific factors that need to be accommodated. It is suggested that a developmentally sensitive adoption of the cognitive model of social anxiety disorder (Clark and Wells 1995) for adolescents may lead to better treatment outcomes.},

  abstract = {Our purpose in the present meta-analysis was to examine the extent to which discrete emotions elicit changes in cognition, judgment, experience, behavior, and physiology; whether these changes are correlated as would be expected if emotions organize responses across these systems; and which factors moderate the magnitude of these effects. Studies (687; 4,946 effects, 49,473 participants) were included that elicited the discrete emotions of happiness, sadness, anger, and anxiety as independent variables with adults. Consistent with discrete emotion theory, there were (a) moderate differences among discrete emotions; (b) differences among discrete negative emotions; and (c) correlated changes in behavior, experience, and physiology (cognition and judgment were mostly not correlated with other changes). Valence, valence--arousal, and approach--avoidance models of emotion were not as clearly supported. There was evidence that these factors are likely important components of emotion but that they could not fully account for the pattern of results. Most emotion elicitations were effective, although the efficacy varied with the emotions being compared. Picture presentations were overall the most effective elicitor of discrete emotions. Stronger effects of emotion elicitations were associated with happiness versus negative emotions, self-reported experience, a greater proportion of women (for elicitations of happiness and sadness), omission of a cover story, and participants alone versus in groups. Conclusions are limited by the inclusion of only some discrete emotions, exclusion of studies that did not elicit discrete emotions, few available effect sizes for some contrasts and moderators, and the methodological rigor of included studies.

The roles and limitations of pilot studies are described here using a clinical trial as an example. A pilot study can be used to evaluate the feasibility of recruitment, randomization, retention, assessment procedures, new methods, and implementation of the novel intervention. A pilot study is not a hypothesis testing study. Safety, efficacy and effectiveness are not evaluated in a pilot. Contrary to tradition, a pilot study does not provide a meaningful effect size estimate for planning subsequent studies due to the imprecision inherent in data from small samples. Feasibility results do not necessarily generalize beyond the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the pilot design. A pilot study is a requisite initial step in exploring a novel intervention or an innovative application of an intervention. Pilot results can inform feasibility and identify modifications needed in the design of a larger, ensuing hypothesis testing study. Investigators should be forthright in stating these objectives of a pilot study. Grant reviewers and other stakeholders should expect no more.},

In this target article, we present a meta-analytic summary of the neuroimaging literature on human emotion. We compare the locationist approach (i.e., the hypothesis that discrete emotion categories consistently and specifically correspond to distinct brain regions) with the psychological constructionist approach (i.e., the hypothesis that discrete emotion categories are constructed of more general brain networks not specific to those categories) to better understand the brain basis of emotion. We review both locationist and psychological constructionist hypotheses of brain-emotion correspondence and report meta-analytic findings bearing on these hypotheses. Overall, we found little evidence that discrete emotion categories can be consistently and specifically localized to distinct brain regions. Instead, we found evidence that is consistent with a psychological constructionist approach to the mind: A set of interacting brain regions commonly involved in basic psychological operations of both an emotional and non-emotional nature are active during emotion experience and perception across a range of discrete emotion categories.},

In this paper, we point out that  is not the final word on the emotion debate. First, we point out that Lench et al.'s findings do not support their claim that discrete emotions organize cognition, judgment, experience, and physiology because they did not demonstrate emotion-consistent and -specific directional changes in these measurement domains. Second, we point out that Lench et al.'s findings are in fact consistent with the alternative (a psychological constructionist approach to emotion). We close by appealing for a construct validity approach to emotion research, which we hope will lead to greater consensus on the operationalization of the natural kind and psychological construction approaches, as well as the criteria required to finally resolve the emotion debate.},

  abstract = {Despite advances in the field of dynamic connectivity, fixed sliding window approaches for the detection of fluctuations in functional connectivity are still widely used. The use of conventional connectivity metrics in conjunction with a fixed sliding window comes with the arbitrariness of the chosen window lengths. In this paper we use multivariate autoregressive and neural mass models with a priori defined ground truths to systematically analyze the sensitivity of conventional metrics in combination with different window lengths to detect genuine fluctuations in connectivity for various underlying state durations. Metrics of interest are the coherence, imaginary coherence, phase lag index, phase locking value and the amplitude envelope correlation. We performed analysis for two nodes and at the network level. We demonstrate that these metrics show indeed higher variability for genuine temporal fluctuations in connectivity compared to a static connectivity state superimposed by noise. Overall, the error of the connectivity estimates themselves decreases for longer state durations (order of seconds), while correlations of the connectivity fluctuations with the ground truth was higher for longer state durations. In general, metrics, in combination with a sliding window, perform poorly for very short state durations. Increasing the SNR of the system only leads to a moderate improvement. In addition, at the network level, only longer window widths were sufficient to detect plausible resting state networks that matched the underlying ground truth, especially for the phase locking value, amplitude envelope correlation and coherence. The length of these longer window widths did not necessarily correspond to the underlying state durations. For short window widths resting state network connectivity patterns could not be retrieved. We conclude that fixed sliding window approaches for connectivity can detect modulations of connectivity, but mostly if the underlying dynamics operate on moderate to slow timescales. In practice, this can be a drawback, as state durations can vary significantly in empirical data.},

Computational models can help identify parameters affecting self-reported mood during mood induction tasks. Here, we test if computationally modeled dynamics of self-reported mood during monetary gambling can be used to identify trial-by-trial variations in neuronal activity. To this end, we shifted mood in healthy (N~=\,24) and depressed (N~=\,30) adolescents by delivering individually tailored reward prediction errors while recording magnetoencephalography (MEG) data. Following a pre-registered analysis, we hypothesize that the expectation component of mood would be predictive of beta-gamma oscillatory power (25-40~Hz). We also hypothesize that trial variations in the source localized responses to reward feedback would be predicted by mood and by its reward prediction error component. Through our multilevel statistical analysis, we found confirmatory evidence that beta-gamma power is positively related to reward expectation during mood shifts, with localized sources in the posterior cingulate cortex. We also confirmed reward prediction error to be predictive of trial-level variations in the response of the paracentral lobule. To our knowledge, this is the first study to harness computational models of mood to relate mood fluctuations to variations in neural oscillations with MEG.},

This review focuses on the overlap and differences between seven neurobiologically valid models and lists 15 predictions assessing reinforcement sensitivity in ADHD. When comparing the models it becomes clear that there are great differences in the level of explanation. For example, some models try to explain a single core deficit in terms lower-level reinforcement systems, such as the dopamine transfer to reward back in time. Other models explain multiple deficits, by describing higher-level systems, such as impaired bottom-up prefrontal activation. When reviewing the available experimental evidence in support of the predictions, most experimental studies have been focusing on behavioral changes in the face of reward and response cost over no-reward, and on delay discounting. There is currently a lack in studies that focus on explaining underlying cognitive or neural mechanisms of altered reinforcement sensitivity in ADHD. Additionally, there is a lack in studies that try to understand what subgroup of children with ADHD shows alterations in reinforcement sensitivity. The scarcity in studies testing the neurobiological predictions is explained partly by a lack in knowledge how to test some of these predictions in humans. Nevertheless, we believe that these predictions can serve as a useful guide to the systematic evaluation of altered reinforcement sensitivity in ADHD.},

The 4-factor model was highly similar to the original SPSRQ factors found in adults (Punishment Sensitivity, Reward Responsivity, Impulsivity/Fun-Seeking, and Drive). The 5-factor model was similar to the 4-factor model, with the exception of a subdivision of the Punishment Sensitivity factor into a factor with 'social-fear' items and a factor with 'anxiety' items. To determine external validity, scores of three groups of children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) were compared on the EFA models: ADHD-only (n\,=\,34), ADHD and autism spectrum disorder (ADHD+ASD; n\,=\,22), ADHD and oppositional defiant disorder (ADHD+ODD; n\,=\,22). All ADHD groups scored higher than typical controls on Reward Responsivity and on the 'anxiety' factor (n\,=\,75). The ADHD-only and ADHD+ODD group scored higher than other groups on Impulsivity/Fun-Seeking and Drive, while the ADHD+ASD group scored higher on Punishment Sensitivity. The findings emphasize the value of the SPSRQ-C to quickly and reliably assess a child's sensitivity to reinforcement, with the aim to provide individually-tailored behavioral interventions that utilize reward and reprimands.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The Affective Reactivity Index (ARI) is widely used to assess young people's irritability symptoms, but youth and caregivers often diverge in their assessments. Such informant discrepancy might be rooted in poor psychometric properties, the differential conceptualization of irritability across informants, or reflect sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. We use an out-of-sample replication approach and leverage longitudinal data, available for a subset of the participants, to test these hypotheses. METHOD: Across two independent samples (NCohort-1\,=\,765, 8-21\,years; NCohort-2\,=\,1910, 6-21\,years), we investigate the reliability and measurement invariance of the ARI, examine sociodemographic and clinical predictors of discrepant reporting and probe the utility of a bifactor model for cross-informant integration. RESULTS: Despite good internal consistency and 6-week-retest-reliability of parent (Cohort-1: {$\alpha$}\,=\,0.92, ICC\,=\,0.85; Cohort-2: {$\alpha$}\,=\,0.93) and youth forms (Cohort-1: {$\alpha$}\,=\,0.88, ICC\,=\,0.78; Cohort-2: {$\alpha$}\,=\,0.82), we confirm substantial informant discrepancy in ARI ratings (3 points on a scale from 0 to 12), which is stable over six weeks (ICC\,=\,0.53). Measurement invariance across informants was weak, indicating that parents and youth may interpret ARI items differently. Irritability severity and diagnostic status predicted informant-discrepancy, albeit in opposing directions: higher severity was linked to relative, higher irritability-ratings by youth (Cohort-1: {$\beta$}\,=\,-0.06, p\,{$<$}\,.001; Cohort-2: {$\beta$}\,=\,-0.06, p\,{$<$}\,.001), while diagnoses of Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (Cohort-1: {$\beta$}\,=\,0.44, p\,{$<$}\,.001; Cohort-2: {$\beta$}\,=\,0.84, p\,{$<$}\,.001) and Oppositional Defiant Disorder (Cohort-1: {$\beta$}\,=\,0.41, p\,{$<$}\,.001; Cohort-2: {$\beta$}\,=\,0.42, p\,{$<$}\,.001) predicted relative higher irritability-ratings by caregivers. In both datasets, a bifactor model parsing informant-specific from shared irritability-related variance fit the data well (CFI\,=\,0.99, RMSEA\,=\,0.05; N2: CFI\,=\,0.99; RMSEA\,=\,0.04). CONCLUSION: Parent and youth ARI reports and their discrepancy are reliable and reflect different interpretations of the scale items; hence they should not be averaged. This finding also suggests that irritability is not a unitary construct. Future work should investigate and model how different aspects of irritability might differ in their impact on the responses of specific informants.},

The role of positive and negative environmental stimuli on mood and whether they can promote mood resilience or susceptibility, remains relatively unexplored. The aim of the present study is to investigate whether mood could be trained to become resilient to negative stimuli. To achieve this, we developed a new task where participants register their mood when rewards, in the form of points, are added or subtracted from their score. Several experimental environments that are characterized by different mood and reward relationships were examined. We identified those that have a greater effect on mood training and then tested these environments in order to examine whether the effect would last over time. We found that training effects are detectable and remain significant after at least 20 rounds. Although exploratory our findings are a first step in our effort to better understand the mechanisms behind mood training.},

  abstract = {Objective To describe the history, factor structure, reliability, and validity of the Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children (MASC). Method In two separate school-based population studies, principal-components factor analysis was used, first, to test a theory-driven factor structure, and second, to develop an empirically derived factor structure for the MASC. In a separate study using a clinical population, test-retest reliability at 3 weeks and 3 months, interrater concordance, and convergent and divergent validity were examined. Results The final version of the MASC consists of 39 items distributed across four major factors, three of which can be parsed into two subfactors each. Main and subfactors include (1) physical symptoms (tense/restless and somatic/autonomic), (2) social anxiety (humiliation/rejection and public performance fears), (3) harm avoidance (perfectionism and anxious coping), and (4) separation anxiety. The MASC factor structure, which presumably reflects the in vivo structure of pediatric anxiety symptoms, is invariant across gender and age and shows excellent internal reliability. As expected, females show greater anxiety on all factors and subfactors than males. Three-week and 3-month test-retest reliability was satisfactory to excellent. Parent-child agreement was poor to fair. Concordance was greatest for easily observable symptom clusters and for mother-child over father-child or father-mother pairs. Shared variance with scales sampling symptom domains of interest was highest for anxiety, intermediate for depression, and lowest for externalizing symptoms, indicating adequate convergent and divergent validity. Conclusion The MASC is a promising self-report scale for assessing anxiety in children and adolescents.},

  abstract = {CONTEXT: The Treatment for Adolescents With Depression Study evaluates the effectiveness of fluoxetine hydrochloride therapy, cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), and their combination in adolescents with major depressive disorder. OBJECTIVE: To report effectiveness outcomes across 36 weeks of randomized treatment. DESIGN AND SETTING: Randomized, controlled trial conducted in 13 academic and community sites in the United States. Cognitive behavior and combination therapies were not masked, whereas administration of placebo and fluoxetine was double-blind through 12 weeks, after which treatments were unblinded. Patients assigned to placebo were treated openly after week 12, and the placebo group is not included in these analyses by design. PARTICIPANTS: Three hundred twenty-seven patients aged 12 to 17 years with a primary DSM-IV diagnosis of major depressive disorder. INTERVENTIONS: All treatments were administered per protocol. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary dependent measures rated blind to treatment status by an independent evaluator were the Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised total score and the response rate, defined as a Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement score of much or very much improved. RESULTS: Intention-to-treat analyses on the Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised identified a significant time x treatment interaction (P {$<$} .001). Rates of response were 73\% for combination therapy, 62\% for fluoxetine therapy, and 48\% for CBT at week 12; 85\% for combination therapy, 69\% for fluoxetine therapy, and 65\% for CBT at week 18; and 86\% for combination therapy, 81\% for fluoxetine therapy, and 81\% for CBT at week 36. Suicidal ideation decreased with treatment, but less so with fluoxetine therapy than with combination therapy or CBT. Suicidal events were more common in patients receiving fluoxetine therapy (14.7\%) than combination therapy (8.4\%) or CBT (6.3\%). CONCLUSIONS: In adolescents with moderate to severe depression, treatment with fluoxetine alone or in combination with CBT accelerates the response. Adding CBT to medication enhances the safety of medication. Taking benefits and harms into account, combined treatment appears superior to either monotherapy as a treatment for major depression in adolescents.},

METHOD: A total of 154 children and adolescents participated in an assessment consisting of a diagnostic interview, the LSAS-CA, and other measures of psychopathology and impairment. Sixty-one of these children also participated in a second LSAS-CA administration, by a different rater blind to diagnosis, within 7 days of the initial assessment. RESULTS: High internal consistency (alpha =.90-.97 for full sample and.83-.95 for social phobia group) and test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.89-0.94) were obtained for LSAS-CA total and subscale scores. LSAS-CA scores had stronger associations with measures of social anxiety and general impairment than with a measure of depression. Subjects with social anxiety disorder had significantly higher LSAS-CA scores than subjects with other anxiety disorders and healthy controls. A LSAS-CA cutoff score of 22.5 represented the best balance of sensitivity and specificity when distinguishing between individuals with social phobia and normal controls, whereas a cutoff of 29.5 was optimal for distinguishing social phobia from other anxiety disorders. CONCLUSION: Initial findings suggest that the LSAS-CA is a reliable and valid instrument for the assessment of social anxiety disorder.},

They have been widely investigated in cognitive and social neuroscience as well as psychology. Research often contrasts the neural processing of social rewards with non-social ones, with the aim to demonstrate the privileged and unique nature of social rewards or to examine shared neural processing underlying them. However, such comparisons mostly neglect other important dimensions of rewards that are conflated in those types of rewards: primacy, temporal proximity, duration, familiarity, source, tangibility, naturalness, and magnitude. We identify how commonly used rewards in both social and non-social domains may differ in respect to these dimensions and how their interaction calls for careful consideration of alternative interpretations of observed effects. Additionally, we propose potential solutions on how to adapt the multidimensional view to experimental research. Altogether, these methodological considerations aim to inform and improve future experimental designs in research utilizing rewarding stimuli, especially in the social domain.},

METHODS: We used cross-sectional data on a nationally representative sample of 10,438 5-15-year-olds drawn from the 1999 British Child Mental Health Survey to examine age trends, gender ratios and patterns of comorbidity in DSM-IV Conduct Disorder (CD) and Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD). RESULTS: CD was significantly more common in boys than girls, and increased in prevalence with age. Among children who met diagnostic criteria for CD, status violations and other non-aggressive conduct problems increased with age, while aggressive symptoms became less common. Gender differences in ODD varied by reporter. Estimates of age trends in ODD depended heavily on treatment of overlaps with CD. Following DSM-IV guidelines (where ODD is not diagnosed in the presence of CD), rates of ODD fell with age; if that constraint was released, clinically significant rates of oppositionality persisted at similar levels from early childhood to middle adolescence. CD and ODD showed high levels of overlap, and both diagnoses showed substantial comorbidity with other non-antisocial disorders. CONCLUSIONS: Results from this large-scale study confirm and extend previous findings in the epidemiology of the disruptive behaviour disorders.},

  abstract = {Children and adolescents with major depressive disorder (MDD) appear to be more responsive to placebo than adults in randomized placebo-controlled trials (RCTs) of second and newer generation antidepressants (SNG-AD). Previous meta-analyses obtained conflicting results regarding modifiers. We aimed to conduct a meta-analytical evaluation of placebo response rates based on both clinician-rating and self-rating scales. Based on the most recent and comprehensive study on adult data, we tested whether the placebo response rates in children and adolescents with MDD also increase with study duration and number of study sites. We searched systematically for published RCTs of SNG-AD in children and/or adolescents (last update: September 2017) in public domain electronic databases and additionally for documented studies in clinical trial databases. The log-transformed odds of placebo response were meta-analytically analyzed. The primary and secondary outcomes were placebo response rates at the end of treatment based on clinician-rating and self-rating scales, respectively. To examine the impact of study duration and number of study sites on placebo response rates, we performed simple meta-regression analyses. We selected other potential modifiers of placebo response based on significance in at least one previous pediatric meta-analysis and on theoretical considerations to perform explorative analyses. We applied sensitivity analyses with placebo response rates closest to week 8 to compare our data with those reported for adults. We identified 24 placebo-controlled trials (2229 patients in the placebo arms). The clinician-rated placebo response rates ranged from 22 to 62\% with a pooled response rate of 45\% (95\% CI 41-50\%). The number of study sites was a significant modifier in the simple meta-regression analysis [odds ratio (OR) 1.01, 95\% CI 1.01-1.02, p\,=\,0.0003, k\,=\,24) with more study sites linked to a higher placebo response. Study duration was not significantly associated with the placebo response rate. The explorative simple analyses revealed that publication year may be an additional modifier. However, in the explorative multivariable analysis including the number of study sites and the publication year only the number of study sites reached a p value\,{$\leq$}\,0.05. The self-rated placebo response rates ranged from 1 to 68\% with a pooled response rate of 26\% (95\% CI 10-54\%) (k\,=\,6; n\,=\,396). This meta-analysis confirms a high pooled placebo response rate in children and adolescents based on clinician ratings, which exceeds that observed in the most recent meta-analysis of placebo effects in adults (36\%; 95\% CI 35-37\%) published in 2016. However, and similar to findings in adults, the pooled response rates based on self-ratings were substantially lower. In accordance with previous meta-analyses, we corroborated the number of study sites as significant modifier. In comparison to the recent adult meta-analysis, the substantially lower number of pediatric studies entails a reduced power to detect modifiers. Future studies should provide more precise and homogenous information to support discovery of potential modifiers and consider no-treatment-if ethically permissible-to allow differentiation between placebo and spontaneous remission rates. If these differ, practicing clinicians should facilitate placebo effects as an addition to the verum effect to maximize benefits. Further research is required to explain the discrepant response rates between clinician and self-ratings.},

Here, we provide an in-depth characterization of disease incidence and mortality and their dependence on demographic and socioeconomic strata in Santiago, a highly segregated city and the capital of Chile. Our analyses show a strong association between socioeconomic status and both COVID-19 outcomes and public health capacity. People living in municipalities with low socioeconomic status did not reduce their mobility during lockdowns as much as those in more affluent municipalities. Testing volumes may have been insufficient early in the pandemic in those places, and both test positivity rates and testing delays were much higher. We find a strong association between socioeconomic status and mortality, measured by either COVID-19-attributed deaths or excess deaths. Finally, we show that infection fatality rates in young people are higher in low-income municipalities. Together, these results highlight the critical consequences of socioeconomic inequalities on health outcomes.},

Social phobia is strongly associated with other anxiety disorders, substance abuse, and affective disorders in both clinical and community samples. An average of 80\% of social phobics identified in community samples meet diagnostic criteria for another lifetime condition. Social phobia is most strongly associated with other subtypes of anxiety disorders, with an average of 50\% of social phobics in the community reporting a concomitant anxiety disorder including another phobic disorder, generalized anciety, or panic disorder. Approximately 20\% of subjects in the community meet lifetime criteria for a major depressive disorder. The onset of social phobia generally precedes that of all other disorders, with the exception of simple phobia. Both clinical severity and treated prevalence are consistently greater among social phobics with comorbid disorders The results of family and twin studies reveal that shared etiologic factors explain a substantial proportion of the comorbidity between social phobia and depression, whereas the association between social phobia and alcoholism derives from a nonfamilial causal relationship between the two conditions. Clinical and phenomenologic implications of these findings are discussed.},

Method The National Comorbidity Survey-Adolescent Supplement NCS-A is a nationally representative face-to-face survey of 10,123 adolescents aged 13--18 years in the continental U.S. DSM-IV mental disorders were assessed using a modified version of the fully structured World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Results Anxiety disorders were the most common condition (31.9\%), followed by behavior disorders (19.1\%), mood disorders (14.3\%), and substance use disorders (11.4\%), with approximately 40\% of those with one class of disorder also meeting criteria for another class of lifetime disorder. The overall prevalence of disorders with severe impairment and/or distress was 22.2\%; (11.2\% with mood disorders; 8.3\% with anxiety disorders; 9.6\% behavior disorders). The median age of onset for disorder classes was earliest for anxiety (6 years), followed by 11 years for behavior, 13 years for mood, and 15 years for substance use disorders. Conclusions These findings provide the first prevalence data on a broad range of mental disorders in a nationally representative sample of U.S. adolescents. Approximately one in every 4--5 youth in the U.S. meets criteria for a mental disorder with severe impairment across their lifetime. The likelihood that common mental disorders in adults first emerge in childhood and adolescence highlights the need for a transition from the common focus on treatment of U.S. youth to that of prevention and early intervention.},

A sample of 184 undergraduates responded to measures of Gray's and other personality dimensions. BAS scores were positively related to and were significant predictors of hyperactive-impulsive symptoms, and also appeared to be related to inattentive AD/HD symptoms in females. Behavioral Inhibition System (BIS) scores did not predict hyperactive-impulsive symptoms, suggesting that it is not a primary deficit for hyperactive-impulsive behaviors. Other disinhibitory pathways along Gray's model, such as a response modulation deficit, were supported.

Method: In this paper these tools are described, i.e. the COSMIN taxonomy and definition of measurement properties; the COSMIN checklist to evaluate the methodological quality of studies on measurement properties; a search filter for finding studies on measurement properties; a protocol for systematic reviews of outcome measurement instruments; a database of systematic reviews of outcome measurement instruments; and a guideline for selecting outcome measurement instruments for Core Outcome Sets in clinical trials. Currently, we are updating the COSMIN checklist, particularly the standards for content validity studies. Also new standards for studies using Item Response Theory methods will be developed. Additionally, in the future we want to develop standards for studies on the quality of non-patient reported outcome measures, such as clinician-reported outcomes and performance-based outcomes. Conclusions: In summary, we plea for more standardization in the use of outcome measurement instruments, for conducting high quality systematic reviews on measurement instruments in which the best available outcome measurement instrument is recommended, and for stopping the use of poor outcome measurement instruments.},

The NHS myHealthE (MHE) web-based monitoring system was developed to address the limitations of paper-based PROM completion. MHE provides a simple and secure way for families accessing Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services to report clinical information and track their child's progress. This study aimed to assess whether MHE improves the completion of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) compared with paper collection. Secondary objectives were to explore caregiver satisfaction and application acceptability. Methods A 12-week single-blinded randomised controlled feasibility pilot trial of MHE was conducted with 196 families accessing neurodevelopmental services in south London to examine whether electronic questionnaires are completed more readily than paper-based questionnaires over a 3-month period. Follow up process evaluation phone calls with a subset (n = 8) of caregivers explored system satisfaction and usability. Results MHE group assignment was significantly associated with an increased probability of completing an SDQ-P in the study period (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 12.1, 95\% CI 4.7--31.0; p = {$<$}.001). Of those caregivers' who received the MHE invitation (n = 68) 69.1\% completed an SDQ using the platform compared to 8.8\% in the control group (n = 68). The system was well received by caregivers, who cited numerous benefits of using MHE, for example, real-time feedback and ease of completion. Conclusions MHE holds promise for improving PROM completion rates. Research is needed to refine MHE, evaluate large-scale MHE implementation, cost effectiveness and explore factors associated with differences in electronic questionnaire uptake.},

  abstract = {This meta-analysis synthesized 226 effect sizes reflecting the relation between self-focused attention and negative affect (depression, anxiety, negative mood). The results demonstrate the multifaceted nature of self-focused attention and elucidate major controversies in the field. Overall, self-focus was associated with negative affect. Several moderators qualified this relationship. Self-focus and negative affect were more strongly related in clinical and female-dominated samples. Rumination yielded stronger effect sizes than nonruminative self-focus. Self-focus on positive self-aspects and following a positive event were related to lower negative affect. Most important, an interaction between foci of self-attention and form of negative affect was found: Private self-focus was more strongly associated with depression and generalized anxiety, whereas public self-focus was more strongly associated with social anxiety.},

  abstract = {Individuals with ADHD appear to respond differently to incentives than their peers. This could be due to a general altered sensitivity to reinforcers. However, apart from differences in the degree of motivation, individuals with ADHD might also be motivated by qualitatively different factors. This study aimed to harvest a range of motivational factors and identify ADHD-related qualitative differences in motivation, from the adolescent's point of view. Semi-structured interviews allowing participants to describe what motivates them in daily life were conducted with young adolescents (9--16~years) with and without ADHD. Thematic analysis was undertaken using NVivo software. Major themes relating to motivation were identified from the interview data. These were: (1) achieving a sense of togetherness; (2) feeling competent; (3) fulfilling a need for variation; (4) gaining pleasure from applying effort to achieve a goal; (5) valuing social reinforcement; (6) desiring to be absorbed/forget problems; (7) feeling free and independent, (8) attaining material reinforcement; and (9) an enjoyment of bodily stimulation. The theme structure was very similar for both groups. However, individuals with ADHD differed in some specifics: their focus on the passing of time, the absence of preference for predictable and familiar tasks, and their less elaborate description of the togetherness theme. A broad range of motivational themes was identified, stretching beyond the current focus of ADHD research and motivational theories. Similarities and differences in motivational values of individuals with and without ADHD should be taken into account in reward sensitivity research, and in psychological treatment.},

However, the relative importance of genetic and environmental aetiology of the covariation between these disorders, particularly the relationship between PD and AG is less clear. Methods The present study measured MD, PD and AG in a population sample of 5440 twin pairs and 1245 single twins, about 45\% of whom were also scored for SP. Prevalences, within individual comorbidity and twin odds ratios for comorbidity are reported. A behavioural genetic analysis of the four disorders using the classical twin design was conducted. Results Odds ratios for MD, PD, AG, and SP in twins of individuals diagnosed with one of the four disorders were increased. Heritability estimates under a threshold-liability model for MD, PD, AG, and SP respectively were 0.33 (CI:0.30--0.42), 0.38 (CI:0.24--0.55), 0.48 (CI:0.37--0.65) of, and 0.39 (CI:0.16--0.65), with no evidence for any variance explained by the common environment shared by twins. We find that a common genetic factor explains a moderate proportion of variance in these four disorders. The genetic correlation between PD and AG was 0.83. Conclusion MD, PD, AG, and SP strongly co-aggregate within families and common genetic factors explain a moderate proportion of variance in these four disorders. The high genetic correlation between PD and AG and the increased odds ratio for PD and AG in siblings of those with AG without PD suggests a common genetic aetiology for PD and AG.},

In this paper, we propose that the extremity of an event, rather than its valence per se, may drive meaning, and test multiple mechanisms that might explain this effect. Across three studies (including one that was pre-registered), we show for the first time a quadratic relationship between event valence and meaningfulness, such that both extremely painful and extremely pleasant events are more meaningful than milder events. Furthermore, we show that this effect is partly mediated by shared features of extreme events; their emotional intensity and tendency to induce contemplation. While extreme positive and extreme negative events differ in many important ways, this research shows that they share key characteristics (including their extremity) that lead people to find them more meaningful.},

  abstract = {In the mental health field, there is a growing awareness that the study of psychiatric symptoms in the context of everyday life, using experience sampling methodology (ESM), may provide a powerful and necessary addition to more conventional research approaches. ESM, a structured self-report diary technique, allows the investigation of experiences within, and in interaction with, the real-world context. This paper provides an overview of how zooming in on the micro-level of experience and behaviour using ESM adds new insights and additional perspectives to standard approaches. More specifically, it discusses how ESM: a) contributes to a deeper understanding of psychopathological phenomena, b) allows to capture variability over time, c) aids in identifying internal and situational determinants of variability in symptomatology, and d) enables a thorough investigation of the interaction between the person and his/her environment and of real-life social interactions. Next to improving assessment of psychopathology and its underlying mechanisms, ESM contributes to advancing and changing clinical practice by allowing a more fine-grained evaluation of treatment effects as well as by providing the opportunity for extending treatment beyond the clinical setting into real life with the development of ecological momentary interventions. Furthermore, this paper provides an overview of the technical details of setting up an ESM study in terms of design, questionnaire development and statistical approaches. Overall, although a number of considerations and challenges remain, ESM offers one of the best opportunities for personalized medicine in psychiatry, from both a research and a clinical perspective.},

  abstract = {The term 'mood' in its scientific usage refers to relatively enduring affective states that arise when negative or positive experience in one context or time period alters the individual's threshold for responding to potentially negative or positive events in subsequent contexts or time periods. The capacity for mood appears to be phylogenetically widespread and the mechanisms underlying it are highly conserved in diverse animals, suggesting it has an important adaptive function. In this review, we discuss how moods can be classified across species, and what the selective advantages of the capacity for mood are. Core moods can be localised within a two-dimensional continuous space, where one axis represents sensitivity to punishment or threat, and the other, sensitivity to reward. Depressed mood and anxious mood represent two different quadrants of this space. The adaptive function of mood is to integrate information about the recent state of the environment and current physical condition of the organism to fine-tune its decisions about the allocation of behavioural effort. Many empirical observations from both humans and non-human animals are consistent with this model. We discuss the implications of this adaptive approach to mood systems for mood disorders in humans.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Within the past decade, health care service and research priorities have shifted from evidence-based medicine to personalized medicine. In mental health care, a similar shift to personalized intervention may boost the effectiveness and clinical utility of empirically supported therapies (ESTs). The emerging science of personalized intervention will need to encompass evidence-based methods for determining which problems to target and in which order, selecting treatments and deciding whether and how to combine them, and informing ongoing clinical decision-making through monitoring of treatment response throughout episodes of care. We review efforts to develop these methods, drawing primarily from psychotherapy research with youths. Then we propose strategies for building a science of personalized intervention in youth mental health. FINDINGS: The growing evidence base for personalizing interventions includes research on therapies adapted for specific subgroups; treatments targeting youths' environments; modular therapies; sequential, multiple assignment, randomized trials; measurement feedback systems; meta-analyses comparing treatments for specific patient characteristics; data-mining decision trees; and individualized metrics. CONCLUSION: The science of personalized intervention presents questions that can be addressed in several ways. First, to evaluate and organize personalized interventions, we propose modifying the system used to evaluate and organize ESTs. Second, to help personalizing research keep pace with practice needs, we propose exploiting existing randomized trial data to inform personalizing approaches, prioritizing the personalizing approaches likely to have the greatest impact, conducting more idiographic research, and studying tailoring strategies in usual care. Third, to encourage clinicians' use of personalized intervention research to inform their practice, we propose expanding outlets for research summaries and case studies, developing heuristic frameworks that incorporate personalizing approaches into practice, and integrating personalizing approaches into service delivery systems. Finally, to build a richer understanding of how and why treatments work for particular individuals, we propose accelerating research to identify mediators within and across RCTs, to isolate mechanisms of change, and to inform the shift from diagnoses to psychopathological processes. This ambitious agenda for personalized intervention science, although challenging, could markedly alter the nature of mental health care and the benefit provided to youths and families.},

  abstract = {Background: Symptoms of depression and anxiety, suicidal ideation, and self-harm have escalated among adolescents to crisis levels during the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, primary care providers (PCPs) are often called on to provide first-line care for these youth. Digital health interventions can extend mental health specialty care, but few are evidence based. We evaluated the feasibility of delivering an evidence-based mobile health (mHealth) app with an embedded conversational agent to deliver cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to symptomatic adolescents presenting in primary care settings during the pandemic. Objective: In this 12-week pilot study, we evaluated the feasibility of delivering the app-based intervention to adolescents aged 13 to 17 years with moderate depressive symptoms who were treated in a practice-based research network (PBRN) of academically affiliated primary care clinics. We also obtained preliminary estimates of app acceptability, effectiveness, and usability. Methods: This small, pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluated depressive symptom severity in adolescents randomized to the app or to a wait list control condition. The primary end point was depression severity at 4-weeks, measured by the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Data on acceptability, feasibility, and usability were collected from adolescents and their parent or legal guardian. Qualitative interviews were conducted with 13 PCPs from 11 PBRN clinics to identify facilitators and barriers to incorporating mental health apps in treatment planning for adolescents with depression and anxiety. Results: The pilot randomized 18 participants to the app (n=10, 56\%) or to a wait list control condition (n=8, 44\%); 17 participants were included in the analysis, and 1 became ineligible upon chart review due to lack of eligibility based on documented diagnosis. The overall sample was predominantly female (15/17, 88\%), White (15/17, 88\%), and privately insured (15/17, 88\%). Mean PHQ-9 scores at 4 weeks decreased by 3.3 points in the active treatment group (representing a shift in mean depression score from moderate to mild symptom severity categories) and 2 points in the wait list control group (no shift in symptom severity category). Teen- and parent-reported usability, feasibility, and acceptability of the app was high. PCPs reported preference for introducing mHealth interventions like the one in this study early in the course of care for individuals presenting with mild or moderate symptoms. Conclusions: In this small study, we demonstrated the feasibility, acceptability, usability, and safety of using a CBT-based chatbot for adolescents presenting with moderate depressive symptoms in a network of PBRN-based primary care clinics. This pilot study could not establish effectiveness, but our results suggest that further study in a larger pediatric population is warranted. Future study inclusive of rural, socioeconomically disadvantaged, and underrepresented communities is needed to establish generalizability of effectiveness and identify implementation-related adaptations needed to promote broader uptake in pediatric primary care.

  abstract = {Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is among the many syndromes in the psychiatric nosology for which etiological signal and clinical prediction are weak. Reducing phenotypic and mechanistic heterogeneity should be useful to arrive at stronger etiological and clinical prediction signals. We discuss key conceptual and methodological issues, highlighting the role of dimensional features aligned with Research Domain Criteria and cognitive, personality, and temperament theory as well as neurobiology. We describe several avenues of work in this area, utilizing different statistical, computational, and machine learning approaches to resolve heterogeneity in ADHD. We offer methodological and conceptual recommendations. Methodologically, we propose that an integrated approach utilizing theory and advanced computational logic to address targeted questions, with consideration of developmental context, can render the heterogeneity problem tractable for ADHD. Conceptually, we conclude that the field is on the cusp of justifying an emotionally dysregulated subprofile in ADHD that may be useful for clinical prediction and treatment testing. Cognitive profiles, while more nascent, may be useful for clinical prediction and treatment assignment in different ways depending on developmental stage. Targeting these psychological profiles for neurobiological and etiological study to capture different pathophysiological routes remains a near-term opportunity. Subtypes are likely to be multifactorial, cut across multiple dimensions, and depend on the research or clinical outcomes of interest for their ultimate selection. In this context parallel profiles based on cognition, emotion, and specific neural signatures appear to be on the horizon, each with somewhat different utilities. Efforts to integrate such cross-cutting profiles within a conceptual dysregulation framework are well underway.},

  abstract = {RATIONALE: Dopamine neurotransmission has long been known to exert a powerful influence over the vigor, strength, or rate of responding. However, there exists no clear understanding of the computational foundation for this effect; predominant accounts of dopamine's computational function focus on a role for phasic dopamine in controlling the discrete selection between different actions and have nothing to say about response vigor or indeed the free-operant tasks in which it is typically measured. OBJECTIVES: We seek to accommodate free-operant behavioral tasks within the realm of models of optimal control and thereby capture how dopaminergic and motivational manipulations affect response vigor. METHODS: We construct an average reward reinforcement learning model in which subjects choose both which action to perform and also the latency with which to perform it. Optimal control balances the costs of acting quickly against the benefits of getting reward earlier and thereby chooses a best response latency. RESULTS: In this framework, the long-run average rate of reward plays a key role as an opportunity cost and mediates motivational influences on rates and vigor of responding. We review evidence suggesting that the average reward rate is reported by tonic levels of dopamine putatively in the nucleus accumbens. CONCLUSIONS: Our extension of reinforcement learning models to free-operant tasks unites psychologically and computationally inspired ideas about the role of tonic dopamine in striatum, explaining from a normative point of view why higher levels of dopamine might be associated with more vigorous responding.},

  abstract = {Adolescent depression is a potentially lethal condition and a leading cause of disability for this age group. There is an urgent need for novel efficacious treatments since half of adolescents with depression fail to respond to current therapies and up to 70\% of those who respond will relapse within 5 years. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has emerged as a promising treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD) in adults who do not respond to pharmacological or behavioral interventions. In contrast, rTMS has not demonstrated the same degree of efficacy in adolescent MDD. We argue that this is due, in part, to conceptual and methodological shortcomings in the existing literature. In our review, we first provide a neurodevelopmentally focused overview of adolescent depression. We then summarize the rTMS literature in adult and adolescent MDD focusing on both the putative mechanisms of action and neurodevelopmental factors that may influence efficacy in adolescents. We then identify limitations in the existing adolescent MDD rTMS literature and propose specific parameters and approaches that may be used to optimize efficacy in this uniquely vulnerable age group. Specifically, we suggest ways in which future studies reduce clinical and neural heterogeneity, optimize neuronavigation by drawing from functional brain imaging, apply current knowledge of rTMS parameters and neurodevelopment, and employ an experimental therapeutics platform to identify neural targets and biomarkers for response. We conclude that rTMS is worthy of further investigation. Furthermore, we suggest that following these recommendations in future studies will offer a more rigorous test of rTMS as an effective treatment for adolescent depression.},

While models of paired comparisons have historical origins in psychological models of choice, today they find applications in fields as diverse as economics, computer science and statistics. Typically, transitivity relations are formalized by describing the relationship among choice probabilities of any three items. In this paper we show that stochastic transitivity relations can be expressed globally by means of comparison functions. In particular, we show that if pij is the probability that item i is chosen over j then we may write pij=F({$\mu$}i-{$\mu$}j) where {$\mu$}i and {$\mu$}j are the merits of item i and j, respectively, and F is a comparison function. For example, when F is a distribution function of a symmetric random variable then the well known linear stochastic order is obtained. Weaker forms of transitivity also admit this formulation with weaker constraints on the class to which F belong. The functional characterizations provide a common mathematical structure and language for studying transitivity relations. They reveal new connections among transitivity models and enable various generalizations of known results. Finally, the functional characterizations provide a foundation for the future development of new classes of statistical models.},

  abstract = {Despite decades of challenges to the idea that a small number of emotions enjoys the special status of ?basic emotions,? the idea continues to have considerable influence in psychology and beyond. However, different theorists have proposed substantially different lists of basic emotions, which suggests that there exists no stable criterion of basicness. To some extent, the basic-emotions enterprise is bedeviled by an overreliance on English affective terms, but there also lurks a more serious problem?the lack of agreement as to what emotions are. To address this problem, three necessary conditions are proposed as a minimal requirement for a mental state to be an emotion. A detailed analysis of surprise, a widely accepted basic emotion, reveals that surprise violates even this minimal test, raising the possibility that it and perhaps other would-be basic emotions might not be emotions at all. An approach that combines ideas such as undifferentiated affect and cognitive appraisal is briefly proposed as a way of theorizing about emotions that is less dependent on the vagaries of language and incoherent notions of basic emotions. Finally, it is suggested that the perennial question of what an emotion is should be given more serious attention.},

Avoidance was found to be significantly higher in all clinical groups relative to the nonclinical group of women, and highest in the comorbid MDD with SAD group. Avoidance showed significant positive relationships with sociotropy, autonomy, rumination, and negative problem orientation, and a significant negative relationship with positive problem orientation within the overall sample of depressed women.

  abstract = {A spate of recent work demonstrates that humans seek to avoid the expenditure of cognitive effort, much like physical effort or economic resources. Less is clear, however, about the circumstances dictating how and when people decide to expend cognitive effort. Here we adopt a popular theory of opportunity costs and response vigor and to elucidate this question. This account, grounded in Reinforcement Learning, formalizes a trade-off between two costs: the harder work assumed necessary to emit faster actions and the opportunity cost inherent in acting more slowly (i.e., the delay that results to the next reward and subsequent rewards). Recent work reveals that the opportunity cost of time-operationalized as the average reward rate per unit time, theorized to be signaled by tonic dopamine levels, modulates the speed with which a person responds in a simple discrimination tasks. We extend this framework to cognitive effort in a diverse range of cognitive tasks, for which 1) the amount of cognitive effort demanded from the task varies from trial to trial and 2) the putative expenditure of cognitive effort holds measureable consequences in terms of accuracy and response time. In the domains of cognitive control, perceptual decision-making, and task-switching, we found that subjects tuned their level of effort exertion in accordance with the experienced average reward rate: when the opportunity cost of time was high, subjects made more errors and responded more quickly, which we interpret as a withdrawal of cognitive effort. That is, expenditure of cognitive effort appeared to be modulated by the opportunity cost of time. Further, and consistent with our account, the strength of this modulation was predicted by individual differences in efficacy of cognitive control. Taken together, our results elucidate the circumstances dictating how and when people expend cognitive effort.},

  abstract = {Dopamine, one of the main neurotransmitters in the mammalian brain, has been implicated in the coding of prediction errors that govern reward learning as well as fear extinction learning. Psychotherapy too can be viewed as a form of error-based learning, because it challenges erroneous beliefs and behavioral patterns in order to induce long-term changes in emotions, cognitions, and behaviors. Exposure therapy, for example, relies in part on fear extinction principles to violate erroneous expectancies of danger and induce novel safety learning that inhibits and therefore reduces fear in the long term. As most forms of psychotherapy, however, exposure therapy suffers from non-response, dropout, and relapse. This narrative review focuses on the role of midbrain and prefrontal dopamine in novel safety learning and investigates possible pathways through which dopamine-based interventions could be used as an adjunct to improve both the response and the long-term effects of the therapy. Convincing evidence exists for an involvement of the midbrain dopamine system in the acquisition of new, safe memories. Additionally, prefrontal dopamine is emerging as a key ingredient for the consolidation of fear extinction. We propose that applying a dopamine prediction error perspective to psychotherapy can inspire both pharmacological and non-pharmacological studies aimed at discovering innovative ways to enhance the acquisition of safety memories. Additionally, we call for further empirical investigations on dopamine-oriented drugs that might be able to maximize consolidation of successful fear extinction and its long-term retention after therapy, and we propose to also include investigations on non-pharmacological interventions with putative prefrontal dopaminergic effects, like working memory training.},

The aim of this study was to investigate RRS validity and reliability in a clinical sample of French patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). Subjects and methods Outpatients with a DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of MDD were recruited from a public academic hospital in France. Depressive symptoms were evaluated by the Beck Depression Inventory, anxiety by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory -- state scale, and quality of life by the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) questionnaire. Confirmatory factor analyses, item-dimension correlations, Cronbach's {$\alpha$}-coefficients, Rasch statistics, and external validity were tested. Differential item functioning analyses were performed for sex. Results A total of 109 patients participated. The final reflection--brooding two-factor model of the RRS showed a good fit (root-mean-square error of approximation 0.041, comparative fit index 0.987, standardized root-mean-square residual 0.048) after removing one item (daily diary writing). Internal item consistency and reliability were satisfactory for the two dimensions. External validity testing confirmed that RRS scores were correlated with Beck Depression Inventory, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and SF-36 scores. There was no differential item functioning across sexes. Conclusion These results demonstrated good scale reliability and validity for assessing rumination in patients with MDD.},

PyTorch is a machine learning library that shows that these two goals are in fact compatible: it provides an imperative and Pythonic programming style that supports code as a model, makes debugging easy and is consistent with other popular scientific computing libraries, while remaining efficient and supporting hardware accelerators such as GPUs. In this paper, we detail the principles that drove the implementation of PyTorch and how they are reflected in its architecture. We emphasize that every aspect of PyTorch is a regular Python program under the full control of its user. We also explain how the careful and pragmatic implementation of the key components of its runtime enables them to work together to achieve compelling performance. We demonstrate the efficiency of individual subsystems, as well as the overall speed of PyTorch on several common benchmarks.},

  abstract = {Despite decades of costly research, we still cannot accurately predict individual differences in cognition from task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Moreover, aiming for methods with higher prediction is not sufficient. To understand brain-cognition relationships, we need to explain how these methods draw brain information to make the prediction. Here we applied an explainable machine-learning (ML) framework to predict cognition from task-based fMRI during the n-back working-memory task, using data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (n~=\,3,989). We compared 9 predictive algorithms in their ability to predict 12 cognitive abilities. We found better out-of-sample prediction from ML algorithms over the mass-univariate and ordinary least squares (OLS) multiple regression. Among ML algorithms, Elastic Net, a linear and additive algorithm, performed either similar to or better than nonlinear and interactive algorithms. We explained how these algorithms drew information, using SHapley Additive explanation, eNetXplorer, Accumulated Local Effects, and Friedman's H-statistic. These explainers demonstrated benefits of ML over the OLS multiple regression. For example, ML provided some consistency in variable importance with a previous study and consistency with the mass-univariate approach in the directionality of brain-cognition relationships at different regions. Accordingly, our explainable-ML framework predicted cognition from task-based fMRI with boosted prediction and explainability over standard methodologies.},

Following RDoC's integrative approach, we aimed to develop brain-based predictive models for cognitive abilities that (a) are developmentally stable over years during adolescence and (b) account for the relationships between cognitive abilities and socio-demographic, psychological and genetic factors. For this, we leveraged the unique power of the large-scale, longitudinal data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study (n~{\textasciitilde}\,11\,k) and combined MRI data across modalities (task-fMRI from three tasks: resting-state fMRI, structural MRI and DTI) using machine-learning. Our brain-based, predictive models for cognitive abilities were stable across 2\,years during young adolescence and generalisable to different sites, partially predicting childhood cognition at around 20\% of the variance. Moreover, our use of 'opportunistic stacking' allowed the model to handle missing values, reducing the exclusion from around 80\% to around 5\% of the data. We found fronto-parietal networks during a working-memory task to drive childhood-cognition prediction. The brain-based, predictive models significantly, albeit partially, accounted for variance in childhood cognition due to (1) key socio-demographic and psychological factors (proportion mediated~=~18.65\% [17.29\%-20.12\%]) and (2) genetic variation, as reflected by the polygenic score of cognition (proportion mediated~=~15.6\% [11\%-20.7\%]). Thus, our brain-based predictive models for cognitive abilities facilitate the development of a robust, transdiagnostic research tool for cognition at the neural level in keeping with the RDoC's integrative framework.},

  abstract = {Context The 1989 UN Convention on the Rights of the Child states that children have the right to be heard in all matters affecting them. The Convention inspired a surge in research that investigates young people's perspectives on health and wellness-related concerns and that involves children as `co-researchers'. Young people's advisory groups (YPAGs) are a widely used method to enable young people's involvement in all research stages, but there is a lack of academic literature to guide researchers on how to set up, run and evaluate the impact of such groups. Objective In this paper, we provide a step-by-step model, grounded in our own experience of setting up and coordinating the Oxford Neuroscience, Ethics and Society Young People's Advisory Group (NeurOx YPAG). This group supports studies at the intersection of ethics, mental health and novel technologies. Our model covers the following stages: deciding on the fit for co-production, recruiting participants, developing collective principles of work, running a meeting and evaluating impact. Results We emphasize that throughout this process, researchers should take a critical stance by reflecting on whether a co-production model fits their research scope and aims; ensuring (or aspiring to) representativeness within the group; valuing different kinds of expertise; and undertaking on-going evaluations on the impact of the group on both the young people and the research. Conclusion Adopting a critical and reflective attitude can increase researchers' capacity to engage youth in democratic and inclusive ways, and to produce research outputs that are aligned with the target audience's needs and priorities.},

Cognitive mechanisms research suggests dysfunctional mental imagery and overgeneral memory could be promising targets to improve mood. This feasibility randomised controlled trial with parallel symptomatic groups (n~=~56) compared a novel imagery-based cognitive behavioural intervention (ICBI) to non-directive supportive therapy (NDST) in school settings. Blind assessments (of clinical symptoms and cognitive mechanisms) took place pre-intervention, post-intervention and follow-up three months later. The trial aimed to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the methodology and interventions, and estimate the likely range of effects of the intervention on self-reported depression. The pre-defined criteria for proceeding to a definitive RCT were met: full recruitment occurred within eleven months; retention was 89\%; ICBI acceptability was above satisfactory; and no harm was indicated. Intention-to-treat analysis found large effects in favour of ICBI (relative to NDST) at post-intervention in reducing depressive symptoms (d~=~-1.34, 95\% CI [-1.87, -0.80]) and improving memory specificity (d~=~0.79 [0.35, 1.23]), a key cognitive target. The findings suggest that ICBI may not only improve mood but also strengthen abilities associated with imagining and planning the future, critical skills at this life stage. A fully powered evaluation of ICBI is warranted. Trial Registration: https://www.isrctn.com/; ISRCTN85369879.},

Such incomplete understanding likely arises from the fact that depression encompasses a heterogeneous set of disorders. To overcome these limitations, renewed interest in intermediate phenotypes (endophenotypes) has resurfaced, and anhedonia has emerged as one of the most promising endophenotypes of depression. Here, a heuristic model is presented postulating that anhedonia arises from dysfunctional interactions between stress and brain reward systems. To this end, we review and integrate three bodies of independent literature investigating the role of (a) anhedonia, (b) dopamine, and (c) stress in depression. In a fourth section, we summarize animal data indicating that stress negatively affects mesocorticolimbic dopaminergic pathways critically implicated in incentive motivation and reinforcement learning. In the last section, we provide a synthesis of these four literatures, present initial evidence consistent with our model, and discuss directions for future research.},

Less attention has been devoted to understanding the emotional environments of maltreated children. One assumption, which has stood without empirical test, is that abused children encounter a high degree of anger in their home environments. Anger exposure is thought to be a source of stress for children in abusive environments and a potential link between the experience of abuse and the development of health and behavioral problems. We tested this notion by assessing data on over 1,000 parents and guardians of 3- to 17-year-old children who were participants in child development studies. Abuse was measured via records from Child Protective Services regarding substantiated and unsubstantiated claims of abuse as well as parent/guardian report. We compared self-reported experiences of anger from parents/guardians of children who have experienced abuse with those who have not. We found support for the claim that caregivers of abused children experience and express high levels of anger. Better characterization of the emotional environments in which abused children develop is critical for understanding how and why abuse affects children and has important implications for informing interventions.},

Studies on VS-responsiveness and trait impulsivity in the healthy population demonstrate the opposite relationship, i.e. impulsivity-scores positively correlated with VS activation during reward processing. Against the background that ADHD may represent an extreme on a continuum of normal variability, the question arises as to how these contrasting findings can be integrated. We discuss three theoretical approaches, each of which integrates the opposing findings: (1) an inverted-u-shape model; (2) a (genetic) moderator model; and (3) the ``unrelated model''. We conclude that at the present stage the number of existing studies in the healthy population as well as in ADHD groups is too small for a final answer.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The literature on the prevalence of mental disorders affecting children and adolescents has expanded significantly over the last three decades around the world. Despite the field having matured significantly, there has been no meta-analysis to calculate a worldwide-pooled prevalence and to empirically assess the sources of heterogeneity of estimates. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of the literature searching in PubMed, PsycINFO, and EMBASE for prevalence studies of mental disorders investigating probabilistic community samples of children and adolescents with standardized assessments methods that derive diagnoses according to the DSM or ICD. Meta-analytical techniques were used to estimate the prevalence rates of any mental disorder and individual diagnostic groups. A meta-regression analysis was performed to estimate the effect of population and sample characteristics, study methods, assessment procedures, and case definition in determining the heterogeneity of estimates. RESULTS: We included 41 studies conducted in 27 countries from every world region. The worldwide-pooled prevalence of mental disorders was 13.4\% (CI 95\% 11.3-15.9). The worldwide prevalence of any anxiety disorder was 6.5\% (CI 95\% 4.7-9.1), any depressive disorder was 2.6\% (CI 95\% 1.7-3.9), attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder was 3.4\% (CI 95\% 2.6-4.5), and any disruptive disorder was 5.7\% (CI 95\% 4.0-8.1). Significant heterogeneity was detected for all pooled estimates. The multivariate metaregression analyses indicated that sample representativeness, sample frame, and diagnostic interview were significant moderators of prevalence estimates. Estimates did not vary as a function of geographic location of studies and year of data collection. The multivariate model explained 88.89\% of prevalence heterogeneity, but residual heterogeneity was still significant. Additional meta-analysis detected significant pooled difference in prevalence rates according to requirement of funcional impairment for the diagnosis of mental disorders. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that mental disorders affect a significant number of children and adolescents worldwide. The pooled prevalence estimates and the identification of sources of heterogeneity have important implications to service, training, and research planning around the world.},

  abstract = {Importance: Great interest exists in identifying methods to predict neuropsychiatric disease states and treatment outcomes from high-dimensional data, including neuroimaging and genomics data. The goal of this review is to highlight several potential problems that can arise in studies that aim to establish prediction. Observations: A number of neuroimaging studies have claimed to establish prediction while establishing only correlation, which is an inappropriate use of the statistical meaning of prediction. Statistical associations do not necessarily imply the ability to make predictions in a generalized manner; establishing evidence for prediction thus requires testing of the model on data separate from those used to estimate the model's parameters. This article discusses various measures of predictive performance and the limitations of some commonly used measures, with a focus on the importance of using multiple measures when assessing performance. For classification, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve is an appropriate measure; for regression analysis, correlation should be avoided, and median absolute error is preferred. Conclusions and Relevance: To ensure accurate estimates of predictive validity, the recommended best practices for predictive modeling include the following: (1) in-sample model fit indices should not be reported as evidence for predictive accuracy, (2) the cross-validation procedure should encompass all operations applied to the data, (3) prediction analyses should not be performed with samples smaller than several hundred observations, (4) multiple measures of prediction accuracy should be examined and reported, (5) the coefficient of determination should be computed using the sums of squares formulation and not the correlation coefficient, and (6) k-fold cross-validation rather than leave-one-out cross-validation should be used.},

  abstract = {From the individual rage-driven violence of domestic abuse to the destructive causes and lasting consequences of large scale ethnic and political conflict, anger and its effects are ubiquitous in human life, and are the focus of intense study across many scientific disciplines: fields as varied as affective neuroscience, health science, psychology, psychophysiology, and sociology have all contributed to recent advances in the understanding of anger. The editors of the International Handbook of Anger bring these major contributions together for a unique portrayal of the many aspects of anger---evolutionary and biological bases, behavioral processes and effects, physiological concomitants, clinical aspects, and role in the larger social picture---with coverage that is both wide-ranging and integrative. State-of-the-art findings by highly regarded experts are organized for maximum utility, with extensive cross-referencing between chapters and editors' introductory commentary linking the book's sections. The International Handbook of Anger presents a wealth of deep and detailed knowledge relevant to clinical and health psychology, social work, family studies, and anger management, among other fields. Its depth and breadth of coverage will make it a definitive volume informing research and practice in the years ahead. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)},

The sum score of the CDRS-R appears to provide a better estimate of depressive symptomatology than does clinical impression. The relationship of the sum of the CDRS-R with global clinical ratings of depression indicates that the scale measures the severity of depression which is its primary purpose. The scale is not affected by the age of the child in our clinical sample, and the content of the items grouped as mood, somatic, subjective, and behavior all show good correlations with depression. The CDRS-R has been shown to be useful in a variety of settings, suggesting it is useful in both primary and secondary depressions.},

This model is substantiated by past literature presented in this chapter to account for how the individual trajectories of emotion knowledge, autobiographical memory, and self-concept representations contribute to the onset, persistence, and progression of anhedonia from early childhood through adolescence.},

Girls reported higher femininity than boys at ages 11, 13, and 15, but girls and boys did not differ in masculinity. Contrary to prevailing views, there was not evidence of intensification in femininity or masculinity. Positive trajectories in masculinity for both girls and boys predicted fewer depressive symptoms, particularly at moderate levels of stress. Findings suggest a need to reconceptualize gender intensification in ways that characterize contemporary adolescence.},

  abstract = {Deep brain stimulation has been of considerable interest to bioethicists, in large part because of the effects that the intervention can occasionally have on central features of the recipient's personality. These effects raise questions regarding the philosophical concept of authenticity. In this article, we expand on our earlier work on the concept of authenticity in the context of deep brain stimulation by developing a diachronic, value-based account of authenticity. Our account draws on both existentialist and essentialist approaches to authenticity, and Laura Waddell Ekstrom's coherentist approach to personal autonomy. In developing our account, we respond to Sven Nyholm and Elizabeth O'Neill's synchronic approach to authenticity, and explain how the diachronic approach we defend can have practical utility, contrary to Alexandre Erler and Tony Hope's criticism of autonomy-based approaches to authenticity. Having drawn a distinction between the authenticity of an individual's traits and the authenticity of that person's values, we consider how our conception of authenticity applies to the context of anorexia nervosa in comparison to other prominent accounts of authenticity. We conclude with some reflections on the prudential value of authenticity, and by highlighting how the language of authenticity can be invoked to justify covert forms of paternalism that run contrary to the value of individuality that seems to be at the heart of authenticity.},

Study 1 demonstrated that depressed subjects were generally less optimistic than their nondepressed counterparts: Although nondepressed subjects rated positive events as more likely to happen to themselves than negative events, depressed subjects did not. In addition, relative to nondepressed subjects, depressed subjects rated positive events as less likely to occur to themselves and more likely to occur to others and negative events as more likely to occur to both self and others. Study 2 investigated the role that differential levels of self-focused attention might play in mediating these differences. On the basis of prior findings that depressed persons generally engage in higher levels of self-focus than nondepressed persons do and the notion that self-focus activates one's self-schema, we hypothesized that inducing depressed subjects to focus externally would attenuate their pessimistic tendencies. Data from Study 2 supported the hypothesis that high levels of self-focus partially mediate depressive pessimism: Whereas self-focused depressed subjects were more pessimistic than nondepressed subjects, externally focused depressed subjects were not. The role of attentional focus in maintaining these and other depressive pessimistic tendencies was discussed.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Alterations in reward processing may represent an early vulnerability factor for the development of depressive disorder. Depression in adults is associated with reward hyposensitivity and diminished reward seeking may also be a feature of depression in children and adolescents. We examined the role of reward responding in predicting depressive symptoms, functional impairment and new-onset depressive disorder over time in the adolescent offspring of depressed parents. In addition, we examined group differences in reward responding between currently depressed adolescents, psychiatric and healthy controls, and also cross-sectional associations between reward responding and measures of positive social/environmental functioning. Method We conducted a 1-year longitudinal study of adolescents at familial risk for depression (n~=~197; age range 10-18 years). Reward responding and self-reported social/environmental functioning were assessed at baseline. Clinical interviews determined diagnostic status at baseline and at follow-up. Reports of depressive symptoms and functional impairment were also obtained. RESULTS: Low reward seeking predicted depressive symptoms and new-onset depressive disorder at the 1-year follow-up in individuals free from depressive disorder at baseline, independently of baseline depressive symptoms. Reduced reward seeking also predicted functional impairment. Adolescents with current depressive disorder were less reward seeking (i.e. bet less at favourable odds) than adolescents free from psychopathology and those with externalizing disorders. Reward seeking showed positive associations with social and environmental functioning (extra-curricular activities, humour, friendships) and was negatively associated with anhedonia. There were no group differences in impulsivity, decision making or psychomotor slowing. CONCLUSIONS: Reward seeking predicts depression severity and onset in adolescents at elevated risk of depression. Adaptive reward responses may be amenable to change through modification of existing preventive psychological interventions.},

This approach offers a framework for analysing emotions and affects that simultaneously pays attention to artefacts and to space. It integrates all of these as basic components of sociality and, by doing so, avoids both the pitfall of their complete culturalisation and that of their total naturalisation. The aim is to achieve a basic `aesthetisation' and `materialisation' of cultural theory, instead. The third part, finally, illuminates the interconnection between emotions and space and argues that in order to explain the cultural change of affective structures in history, the analysis of the emergence of new artefact-space complexes is indispensable.},

The second argument, however, is that psychiatric measurement presents some unique challenges to the application of IRT -- challenges that may not be easily addressed by application of conventional IRT models and methods. These challenges include, but are not limited to, the modeling of conceptually narrow constructs and their associated limited item pools, and unipolar constructs where the expected latent trait distribution is highly skewed.},

Methods Data were from the Growing Up Today Study, a national cohort of U.S. young adults. A two-step method (maternal-reported natal sex in 1996 cross-classified with participant-reported current gender identity in 2010) was used to identify gender minority and non-gender minority respondents (n=7831; mean age=26 years). Differences in past-week depressive symptoms and anxious symptoms were examined cross-sectionally by gender identity. Gender minority and non-gender minority respondents were compared using age-adjusted logistic regression models. Results In gender minorities, the prevalence of depressive and anxious symptoms meeting clinical cutoffs was 52\% and 38\%, respectively compared to non-gender minorities (27\% and 30\% in females and 25\% and 14\% in males) (p{$<$}0.01). Conclusion Gender identity is an understudied social determinant of mental health. Surveillance efforts to monitor mental health disparities should include survey questions to assess gender identity in epidemiologic research. Research and interventions to understand and ameliorate mental health disparities by gender identity are needed.},

The genetic architecture and treatment response profiles for adults and adolescents differ even though identical criteria are used to diagnose depression across different age groups. There is no clear consensus on how these groups differ in their symptom profiles. METHODS: Using data from a two-generation family study, we compared the presentation of DSM-IV depressive symptoms in adolescents and adults with MDD (Major Depressive Disorder). We also compared DSM-IV depressive symptom counts using latent class analysis. RESULTS: Vegetative symptoms (appetite and weight change, loss of energy and insomnia) were more common in adolescent MDD than adult MDD. Anhedonia/loss of interest and concentration problems were more common in adults with MDD. When using latent class analysis to look at depressive symptoms, a vegetative symptom profile was also seen in adolescent depression only. LIMITATIONS: Adults and adolescents were recruited in different ways. Adolescent cases were more likely to be first-onset while adult cases were recurrences. It was not possible to examine how recurrence affected adolescent depression symptom profiles. CONCLUSION: Differences in how depression presents in adolescents and adults may be consistent with different pathophysiological mechanisms. For adolescents, we found that vegetative/physical disturbances were common (loss of energy, changes in weight, appetite and sleep changes). For adults, anhedonia/loss of interest and concentration difficulties were more common.},

  abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Early-onset major depressive disorder (MDD) is common in individuals at high familial risk of depression and is associated with poor long-term mental health, social, and educational outcomes. OBJECTIVES: To examine the developmental pathways that lead to first-episode adolescent-onset MDD (incident cases) in those at high familial risk and to postulate a theoretically informed model that enables simultaneous testing of different pathways to incident adolescent-onset MDD composed of contributions from familial/genetic and social risk factors, as well as effects via specific clinical antecedents. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This investigation was a 4-year longitudinal study (April 2007 to March 2011) among offspring of depressed parents in the general community. Analyses were conducted between September 1, 2015, and May 27, 2016. Participants were 337 families in whom the index parent (315 mothers and 22 fathers) had experienced at least 2 episodes of MDD (recruited through primary care) and among whom there was a biologically related child in the age range of 9 to 17 years living with the index parent (197 girls and 140 boys with a mean [SD] age of 12.4 [2.0] years) at baseline. Offspring with MDD before the study or at baseline (n\,=\,27), offspring with an episode of MDD that had remitted by follow-up (n\,=\,4), and offspring with missing baseline MDD data (n\,=\,2) were excluded. Ninety-two percent (279 of 304) of families completed the follow-up. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was new-onset offspring MDD, and the secondary outcome was the total DSM-IV MDD symptom score. RESULTS: On average, children and adolescents had a mean (SD) of 1.85 (1.74) (range, 0-8.5) DSM-IV symptoms of MDD at follow-up. Twenty (6 males and 14 females) had new-onset MDD, with a mean (SD) age at onset of 14.4 (2.0) years (range, 10-18 years). Irritability ({$\beta$}\,=\,0.12, P\,=\,.03) and fear and/or anxiety ({$\beta$}\,=\,0.38, P\,{$<$}\,.001) were significant independent clinical antecedents of new adolescent-onset MDD, but disruptive behavior ({$\beta$}\,=\,-0.08, P\,=\,.14) and low mood ({$\beta$}\,=\,-0.03, P\,=\,.65) were not. The results were similar for the DSM-IV symptom count at follow-up. All the measured familial/genetic and social risk indicators directly influenced risk for new-onset MDD rather than indirectly through acting on dimensional clinical antecedents. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: There are multiple pathways to first-onset adolescent depression in individuals at familial risk. Irritability and fear/anxiety may be additional clinical phenomena to be included as targets in primary preventive interventions focusing on the child. In addition to targeting these phenomena in parents and children, depression prevention methods in high-risk groups may need to take into consideration social risks, such as poverty and psychosocial adversity.},

Contra-hedonic motivations of wanting either to maintain or enhance negative affect or to dampen positive affect were most prevalent in adolescence, whereas prohedonic motivations of wanting either to maintain, but not enhance, positive affect or to dampen negative affect were most prevalent in old age. This pattern was mirrored by an age-related increase in self-reported day-to-day emotional well-being. Analyses of the emotional experiences that accompanied prohedonic and contra-hedonic motivations are consistent with the notions that contra-hedonic motivations are more likely to serve utilitarian than hedonic functions, and that people are more likely to be motivated to maintain negative affect when it is accompanied by positive affect. Implications for understanding affective development are discussed.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Irritability, which is strongly associated with impairment and negative outcomes, is a common reason for referral to mental health services but is a nosological and treatment challenge. A major issue is how irritability should be conceptualized. The authors used a developmental approach to test the hypothesis that there are several forms of irritability, including a "neurodevelopmental/ADHD-like" type, with onset in childhood, and a "depression/mood" type, with onset in adolescence. METHODS: Data were analyzed from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, a prospective U.K. population-based cohort. Irritability trajectory classes were estimated for 7,924 individuals with data at multiple time points across childhood and adolescence (four possible time points from approximately ages 7 to 15). Psychiatric diagnoses were assessed at approximately ages 7 and 15. Psychiatric genetic risk was indexed by polygenic risk scores (PRSs) for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and depression, derived using large genome-wide association study results. RESULTS: Five irritability trajectory classes were identified: low (81.2\%), decreasing (5.6\%), increasing (5.5\%), late-childhood limited (5.2\%), and high-persistent (2.4\%). The early-onset high-persistent trajectory was associated with male preponderance, childhood ADHD (odds ratio=108.64, 95\% CI=57.45-204.41), and ADHD PRS (odds ratio=1.31, 95\% CI=1.09-1.58). The adolescent-onset increasing trajectory was associated with female preponderance, adolescent depression (odds ratio=5.14, 95\% CI=2.47-10.73), and depression PRS (odds ratio=1.20, 95\% CI=1.05-1.38). Both the early-onset high-persistent and adolescent-onset increasing trajectory classes were associated with adolescent depression diagnosis and ADHD PRS. CONCLUSIONS: The developmental context of irritability may be important in its conceptualization: early-onset persistent irritability may be more neurodevelopmental/ADHD-like and later-onset irritability more depression/mood-like. These findings have implications for treatment as well as nosology.},

Using a three-level modeling approach, we conducted a meta-analysis of all effect sizes from randomized controlled studies of MFSs used in the treatment of common mental health disorders. Eighty-two effect sizes were extracted from the thirty-one included studies. Analyses were performed to consider the post-treatment effects of the MFS-assisted treatment compared to treatment as usual. A separate analysis was done for the subgroup ``not-on-track'' patients as it is theorized that MFSs will be clinically useful because they make therapists aware of patients who fail to progress. MFSs had a significant effect on mental health outcomes (d\,=\,0.14, 95\% CI [0.082--0.206], p\,{$<$}\,.001). Further analysis found a larger effect in patients identified as less respondent to therapy, the ``not-on-track'' group (d\,=\,0.29, 95\% CI [0.114, 0.464], p\,=\,.003). Moderation analyses indicated that the type of outcome measurement and type of feedback system used, and whether it was used for a child and youth or adult population, influenced effect sizes. MFSs seem to have a small positive effect on treatment outcomes. The effects seem to be larger for ``not-on-track'' patients, the group of patients that would usually not benefit much from treatment.},

This leads to a theory of the evolutionary adaptive value of emotions, which is that different genes specify different goals in their own self-interest, and any actions can then be learned and performed by instrumental learning to obtain the goals. The brain mechanisms for emotion in brain regions such as the orbitofrontal and anterior cingulate cortex provide a foundation for understanding the neural basis of emotion. Classically conditioned effects may modulate the actions initiated by this system. In addition to this instrumental learning system, some stimuli may elicit responses, for example approach, withdrawal, or fixed action patterns, but intervening states are not required for this type of adaptive response. In addition, a rational thought system involved in multistep planning can allow gene-specified goals to be deferred or avoided in order to achieve longer-term types of goals that may be more advantageous to the individual than to the genes.},

New epidemiologic data on these topics are presented from the National Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCS-R). Methods The NCS-R is a nationally representative household survey fielded in 2001--2003. The WHO Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI 3.0) was used to assess 14 performance and interactional fears and DSM-IV social phobia. Results The estimated lifetime and 12-month prevalence of social phobia are 12.1\% and 7.1\%. Performance and interactional fears load onto a single latent factor, and there is little evidence for distinct subtypes based either on the content or number of fears. Social phobia is associated with significant psychiatric comorbidity, role impairment, and treatment-seeking, all of which have a dose-response relationship with number of social fears. However, social phobia is the focus of clinical attention in only about half of cases where treatment is obtained. Among non-comorbid cases, those with the most fears were least likely to receive social phobia treatment. Conclusions Social phobia is a common, under-treated disorder that leads to significant functional impairment. Increasing numbers of social fears are associated with increasingly severe manifestations of the disorder.},

METHODS: Outpatients enrolled in the STAR*D trial completed the Psychiatric Diagnostic Screening Questionnaire (PDSQ). An a priori 90\% specificity threshold was set for PDSQ responses to ascertain the presence of 11 different concurrent DSM-IV Axis I disorders. RESULTS: Of 1376 outpatients, 38.2\% had no concurrent comorbidities, while 25.6\% suffered one, 16.1\% suffered two, and 20.2\% suffered three or more comorbid conditions. Altogether, 29.3\% met threshold for social anxiety disorder, 20.8\% for generalized anxiety disorder, 18.8\% for posttraumatic stress disorder, 12.4\% for bulimia, 11.9\% for alcohol abuse/dependence, 13.4\% for obsessive-compulsive disorder, 11.1\% for panic disorder, 9.4\% for agoraphobia, 7.3\% for drug abuse/dependence, 3.7\% for hypochondriasis, and 2.2\% for somatoform disorder. Those with more concurrent Axis I conditions had earlier ages at first onset of MDD, longer histories of MDD, greater depressive symptom severity, more general medical comorbidity (even though they were younger than those with fewer comorbid conditions), poorer physical and mental function, health perceptions, and life satisfaction; and were more likely to be seen in primary care settings. LIMITATIONS: Participants had to meet entry criteria for STAR*D. Ascertainment of comorbid conditions was not based on a structured interview. CONCLUSIONS: Concurrent Axis I conditions (most often anxiety disorders) are very common with MDD. Greater numbers of concurrent comorbid conditions were associated with increased severity, morbidity, and chronicity of their MDD.},

  abstract = {Categorical models of emotions posit neurally and physiologically distinct human basic emotions. We tested this assumption by using multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) to classify brain activity patterns of 6 basic emotions (disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, anger, and surprise) in 3 experiments. Emotions were induced with short movies or mental imagery during functional magnetic resonance imaging. MVPA accurately classified emotions induced by both methods, and the classification generalized from one induction condition to another and across individuals. Brain regions contributing most to the classification accuracy included medial and inferior lateral prefrontal cortices, frontal pole, precentral and postcentral gyri, precuneus, and posterior cingulate cortex. Thus, specific neural signatures across these regions hold representations of different emotional states in multimodal fashion, independently of how the emotions are induced. Similarity of subjective experiences between emotions was associated with similarity of neural patterns for the same emotions, suggesting a direct link between activity in these brain regions and the subjective emotional experience.},

For major depression diagnoses and depression symptoms, respectively, we meta-analyzed data from 65 and 95 articles and their corresponding national datasets, representing data from 1,716,195 and 1,922,064 people in over 90 different nations. Overall, OR = 1.95, 95\% CI [1.88, 2.03] and d = 0.27 [0.26, 0.29]. Age was the strongest predictor of effect size. The gender difference for diagnoses emerged earlier than previously thought, with OR = 2.37 at age 12. For both meta-analyses, the gender difference peaked in adolescence (OR = 3.02 for ages 13--15, and d = 0.47 for age 16) but then declined and remained stable in adulthood. Cross-national analyses indicated that larger gender differences were found in nations with greater gender equity, for major depression, but not depression symptoms. The gender difference in depression represents a health disparity, especially in adolescence, yet the magnitude of the difference indicates that depression in males should not be overlooked.},

Cognitive theories suggest that the way in which exposure to avoided situations is implemented in either treatment may be crucial. In particular, it is suggested that clinical improvement will be greatest if opportunities for disconfirmation of feared catastrophes are maximized. In a small pilot study, 16 patients with panic disorder and (moderate or severe) agoraphobia were randomly allocated to either habituation based exposure therapy (HBET) or exposure planned as a belief disconfirmation strategy and accompanied by dropping of safety-seeking behaviours. Both treatments were brief (total of 3.25h of exposure) and were similar in terms of expectancy of change. Patients in the CBT condition showed significantly greater improvements in self-report measures of anxiety, panic and situational avoidance. They also completed significantly more steps in a standardized behavioural walk, during which they experienced significantly less anxiety. The controlled effect sizes for CBT were substantial (range 1.7--2.7), which suggests it may be a particularly efficient way of managing therapeutic exposure to feared situations in panic disorder with agoraphobia. Further research is needed to clarify the mechanism of change involved.},

While the animal literature supports a role for the dACC in integrating reward history over time, most human electrophysiological studies of dACC function have focused on responses to single positive and negative outcomes. The present electrophysiological study investigated the role of the dACC in probabilistic reward learning in healthy subjects using a task that required integration of reinforcement history over time. We recorded the feedback-related negativity (FRN) to reward feedback in subjects who developed a response bias toward a more frequently rewarded (``rich'') stimulus (``learners'') versus subjects who did not (``non-learners''). Compared to non-learners, learners showed more positive (i.e., smaller) FRNs and greater dACC activation upon receiving reward for correct identification of the rich stimulus. In addition, dACC activation and a bias to select the rich stimulus were positively correlated. The same participants also completed a monetary incentive delay (MID) task administered during functional magnetic resonance imaging. Compared to non-learners, learners displayed stronger basal ganglia responses to reward in the MID task. These findings raise the possibility that learners in the probabilistic reinforcement task were characterized by stronger dACC and basal ganglia responses to rewarding outcomes. Furthermore, these results highlight the importance of the dACC to probabilistic reward learning in humans.},

The aim of this study was to investigate whether the proposed processes of change according to the cognitive model of social anxiety disorder predicted subsequent symptom reduction in CBT delivered as therapist-guided bibliotherapy. We analyzed data from patients with social anxiety disorder (N\,=\,61) who participated in an effectiveness trial of CBT in primary care. Seven putative processes and outcome (i.e., social anxiety) were assessed on a weekly basis throughout treatment. We used linear mixed models to analyze within-person relations between processes and outcome. The results showed a unidirectional effect of reduced avoidance on subsequent decrease in social anxiety. Further, we found support for reciprocal influences between four of the proposed processes (i.e., estimated probability and cost of adverse outcome, self-focused attention, and safety behaviors) and social anxiety. The remaining two processes, (i.e., anticipatory and post-event processing) did not predict subsequent social anxiety, but were predicted by prior symptom reduction. The findings support that several of the change processes according to the cognitive model of social anxiety disorder are involved in symptom improvement.},

This is despite the number of referrals and numbers of treated patients also increasing year-on-year, suggesting that services have evolved local practices and treatment delivery to meet needs whilst improving performance. This study explores whether there have been changes in clinical practice with regard to: (1) the number of sessions and length of treatments; (2) the number of cancellations and non-attendance; and (3) the recording of problem descriptor information, and the association with treatment outcomes in IAPT. Routinely collected data from seven IAPT services involved in the North and Central East London (NCEL) IAPT Service Improvement and Research Network (SIRN) were brought together to form a dataset of nearly 88,000 patients who completed a course of IAPT treatment. Results showed that there was a slight increase in the average number of sessions, and decreases in the length of time in treatment, as well as decreases in both the number of non-attended appointments and the use of inappropriate problem descriptors. These findings highlight a number of areas where potentially small changes to clinical practice may have had positive effects on patient outcomes. The value of using IAPT data to inform service improvement evaluations is discussed.Key learning aims(1) How changes to treatment-delivery factors are associated with IAPT patient outcomes.(2) The link between clinical practice and potential service performance.(3) How analysing routinely collected data can be used to inform service improvement.},

I argue that most claims in the literature are so critically underspecified that attempts to empirically evaluate them are doomed to failure---they are not even wrong. Meta-scientists should beware of the flawed assumption that the psychological literature is a collection of well-defined claims.

A temporal discounting (TD) task and a probabilistic discounting (PD) task were used to measure the degree to which the subjective value of a large reward decreased as one had to wait longer for it (TD), and as the probability of obtaining it decreased (PD). Rewards used were small amounts of money. In the TD task, the large reward (10 cents) was delayed by between 0 and 30s, and the immediate reward varied in magnitude (0--10 cents). In the PD task, receipt of the large reward (10 cents) varied in likelihood, with probabilities of 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1.0 used, and the certain reward varied in magnitude (0--10 cents). Age and diagnostic group did not affect the degree of PD of rewards: All participants made choices so that total gains were maximized. As predicted, young children, aged 6--11 years (n=25) demonstrated steeper TD of rewards than adolescents, aged 12--17 years (n=21). This effect remained significant even when choosing the immediate reward did not shorten overall task duration. This, together with the lack of interaction between TD task version and age, suggests that steeper discounting in young children is driven by reward immediacy and not by delay aversion. Contrary to our predictions, participants with ADHD (n=22) did not demonstrate steeper TD of rewards than controls (n=24). These results raise the possibility that strong preferences for small immediate rewards in ADHD, as found in previous research, depend on factors such as total maximum gain and the use of fixed versus varied delay durations. The decrease in TD as observed in adolescents compared to children may be related to developmental changes in the (dorsolateral) prefrontal cortex. Future research needs to investigate these possibilities.},

However, it remains unclear which of the complex interventions are associated with an anxiety reduction during the course of treatment. The aim of this study was to examine the impact of the intervention referred to as the "self-focused attention and safety behaviours experiment" on treatment outcome. METHOD: This study was part of a randomized controlled trial including 16 sessions of either individual cognitive therapy (CT) or interpersonal therapy (IPT) for SAD. Of particular importance, a concomitant time-series analysis was used to investigate the impact of the self-focused attention and safety behaviours experiment on subsequent social anxiety (1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks after the intervention) in 32 patients with SAD, who are receiving cognitive treatment. RESULTS: The results revealed a significant reduction of social anxiety after the self-focused attention and safety behaviours experiment during the subsequent month of treatment. CONCLUSION: The findings of the current study confirm current cognitive theories of SAD and demonstrate the importance of interventions that target self-focused attention and safety behaviour in cognitive therapy for SAD.},

In the present article, this Power Approach (which in practice usually consists of testing the hypothesis of no difference at level 0.05 and requiring an estimated power of 0.80) is compared to another statistical approach, the Two One-Sided Tests Procedure, which leads to the same conclusion as the approach proposed by Westlake based on the usual (shortest) 1-2 alpha confidence interval for the true average difference. It is found that for the specific choice of alpha = 0.05 as the nominal level of the one-sided tests, the two one-sided tests procedure has uniformly superior properties to the power approach in most cases. The only cases where the power approach has superior properties when the true averages are equivalent correspond to cases where the chance of concluding equivalence with the power approach when the true averages are not equivalent exceeds 0.05. With appropriate choice of the nominal level of significance of the one-sided tests, the two one-sided tests procedure always has uniformly superior properties to the power approach. The two one-sided tests procedure is compared to the procedure proposed by Hauck and Anderson.},

Learning occurs when the actual outcome differs from the predicted outcome, resulting in a prediction error. Neurons in several brain structures appear to code prediction errors in relation to rewards, punishments, external stimuli, and behavioral reactions. In one form, dopamine neurons, norepinephrine neurons, and nucleus basalis neurons broadcast prediction errors as global reinforcement or teaching signals to large postsynaptic structures. In other cases, error signals are coded by selected neurons in the cerebellum, superior colliculus, frontal eye fields, parietal cortex, striatum, and visual system, where they influence specific subgroups of neurons. Prediction errors can be used in postsynaptic structures for the immediate selection of behavior or for synaptic changes underlying behavioral learning. The coding of prediction errors may represent a basic mode of brain function that may also contribute to the processing of sensory information and the short-term control of behavior.},

METHOD: Two hundred forty-seven youths were selected from the 1,285 parent-youth pairs that constituted the four-site MECA sample. Subjects who screened positive for any of the five diagnostic areas under investigation in the validity study (attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, depressive disorder, and the major anxiety disorders) were recruited, as well as a comparable number of screen negatives. Clinicians reinterviewed separately both the youth and the primary caregiver using the DISC followed by a clinical-style interview, and then they rated the presence of symptoms and impairment. Computer algorithms combined this information into diagnoses using comparable rules for both DISC and clinical rating diagnoses. RESULTS: In general, the DISC showed moderate to good validity across a number of diagnoses. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest some specific diagnostic areas in which further revision of the DISC is warranted. Three main sources of variability in DISC-clinician diagnostic agreement were evident over and above that due to the instrument itself, including (1) the informant used, (2) the algorithm applied in synthesizing symptom reports, and (3) the design of the validity comparison.},

Indeed, difficulties in close relationships can contribute to emotional adjustment problems, and emotional problems can adversely affect close relationships. Moreover, different close relationships are especially significant in terms of development and adjustment at different stages of the life span. The current review focuses on childhood and adolescence, developmental stages at which friendships are particularly important. This article presents the results of 16 meta-analyses including 589 unique effects from 233 studies that examine concurrent and longitudinal associations between youths' friendship experiences (number of friends, positive friendship quality, negative friendship quality) and their emotional adjustment (depressive symptoms and loneliness). Studies examining these associations are mixed in regard to whether significant effects emerge. The current research synthesis provides more stable estimates of the effects. In fact, relatively small but significant concurrent and longitudinal associations emerged between the 3 indices of friendship with depressive symptoms and loneliness. The results also suggest that friendship experiences may be more closely linked with loneliness than depressive symptoms and that negative friendship quality may be related to friendship experiences more strongly than number of friends or positive friendship quality. Interestingly, some of the relations were found to be stronger for younger youth. Implications for prevention and intervention efforts are discussed.

Method A total of 17 face-to-face cross-sectional household surveys of adults were conducted in 16 countries (n = 88 063) as part of the World Mental Health Surveys initiative. The World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI 3.0) assessed DSM-IV IED, using a conservative definition. Results Lifetime prevalence of IED ranged across countries from 0.1 to 2.7\% with a weighted average of 0.8\%; 0.4 and 0.3\% met criteria for 12-month and 30-day prevalence, respectively. Sociodemographic correlates of lifetime risk of IED were being male, young, unemployed, divorced or separated, and having less education. The median age of onset of IED was 17 years with an interquartile range across countries of 13--23 years. The vast majority (81.7\%) of those with lifetime IED met criteria for at least one other lifetime disorder; co-morbidity was highest with alcohol abuse and depression. Of those with 12-month IED, 39\% reported severe impairment in at least one domain, most commonly social or relationship functioning. Prior traumatic experiences involving physical (non-combat) or sexual violence were associated with increased risk of IED onset. Conclusions Conservatively defined, IED is a low prevalence disorder but this belies the true societal costs of IED in terms of the effects of explosive anger attacks on families and relationships. IED is more common among males, the young, the socially disadvantaged and among those with prior exposure to violence, especially in childhood.},

It argues people diagnosed with mental illnesses are often stereotyped in such a way as to deflate their credibility, and that the authoritative and even exclusive status accorded to third-person, medical perspectives on experiences of mental illness leads to hermeneutical marginalization and silencing. The chapter takes as its starting-point the idea that epistemic injustice can be countered by recognition of the ways in which the marginalized person is in fact epistemically privileged. It also argues that recognizing the ways in which people diagnosed with mental illnesses have access to distinctive and/or unique forms of knowledge can correct our testimonial sensibilities and provide us with new hermeneutical resources, and is therefore a route to epistemic justice. The chapter explores ways in which this might be the case in relation to experiences of mental illness.},

METHOD: Data were collected on the DISC-2.3 at four sites on 1,285 randomly selected children, aged 9 through 17 years, and their parents. Two hundred forty-seven of these child-parent pairs were reassessed on the DISC-2.3 by a clinician interviewer, 1 to 3 weeks later. RESULTS: Administration time was approximately 1 hour and the interview was acceptable to more than 90\% of subjects. The reliability of questions to parents assessing impairment and age of onset was generally good to acceptable for most diagnoses but was less satisfactory for the child interview. Using information from parent and child, the prevalence for any diagnosis ranged from 50.6 if no impairment criteria were required to 5.4 if a Global Assessment Scale score of 50 or less was necessary. The prevalence of anxiety disorders and enuresis was markedly reduced by requiring attributable impairment. CONCLUSIONS: The DISC-2 is a reliable and economical tool for assessing child psychopathology. Reliability of the DISC-P-2.3 is superior to that of the child DISC for most diagnoses but is least good for anxiety disorders. The 2.3 version of the instrument provides a significant improvement over earlier versions.},

The authors examine the current literature using both quantitative and qualitative methods. Three key findings emerge. First, emotion dysregulation is prevalent in ADHD throughout the lifespan and is a major contributor to impairment. Second, emotion dysregulation in ADHD may arise from deficits in orienting toward, recognizing, and/or allocating attention to emotional stimuli; these deficits implicate dysfunction within a striato-amygdalo-medial prefrontal cortical network. Third, while current treatments for ADHD often also ameliorate emotion dysregulation, a focus on this combination of symptoms reframes clinical questions and could stimulate novel therapeutic approaches. The authors then consider three models to explain the overlap between emotion dysregulation and ADHD: emotion dysregulation and ADHD are correlated but distinct dimensions; emotion dysregulation is a core diagnostic feature of ADHD; and the combination constitutes a nosological entity distinct from both ADHD and emotion dysregulation alone. The differing predictions from each model can guide research on the much-neglected population of patients with ADHD and emotion dysregulation.},

Method Representative contributions to writing on mood disorders over the past hundred years have been systematically evaluated. Results The concept of two separate depressions does indeed emerge in the psychiatric literature from the very beginning of modern writing about the concept of `melancholia'. For the principal nosologists of psychiatry, melancholic depression has always meant something quite different from non-melancholic depression. Exceptions to this include Aubrey Lewis and Karl Leonhard. Yet the balance of opinion among the chief theorists overwhelmingly favors the existence of two quite different illnesses. Conclusion The concept of `major depression' popularized in DSM-III in 1980 is a historical anomaly. It mixes together psychopathologic entities that previous generations of experienced clinicians and thoughtful nosologists had been at pains to keep separate. Recently, there has been a tendency to return to the concept of two depressions: melancholic and non-melancholic illness. `Major depression' is coming into increasing disfavor. In the next edition of DSM (DSM-V), major depression should be abolished; melancholic mood disorder (MMD) and non-melancholic mood disorder (NMMD) should become two of the principle entities in the mood disorder section.},

Finally, the manner in which role-taking emotions (feelings that presuppose role taking) facilitate social control is treated, using symbolic interactionist tenets. I conclude by arguing for the necessity of sociological investigations of emotion for a full understanding of both emotion and social life.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Experimental studies and small clinical trials have suggested that treatment with intranasal oxytocin may reduce social impairment in persons with autism spectrum disorder. Oxytocin has been administered in clinical practice to many children with autism spectrum disorder. METHODS: We conducted a 24-week, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial of intranasal oxytocin therapy in children and adolescents 3 to 17 years of age with autism spectrum disorder. Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio, with stratification according to age and verbal fluency, to receive oxytocin or placebo, administered intranasally, with a total target dose of 48 international units daily. The primary outcome was the least-squares mean change from baseline on the Aberrant Behavior Checklist modified Social Withdrawal subscale (ABC-mSW), which includes 13 items (scores range from 0 to 39, with higher scores indicating less social interaction). Secondary outcomes included two additional measures of social function and an abbreviated measure of IQ. RESULTS: Of the 355 children and adolescents who underwent screening, 290 were enrolled. A total of 146 participants were assigned to the oxytocin group and 144 to the placebo group; 139 and 138 participants, respectively, completed both the baseline and at least one postbaseline ABC-mSW assessments and were included in the modified intention-to-treat analyses. The least-squares mean change from baseline in the ABC-mSW score (primary outcome) was -3.7 in the oxytocin group and -3.5 in the placebo group (least-squares mean difference, -0.2; 95\% confidence interval, -1.5 to 1.0; P\,=\,0.61). Secondary outcomes generally did not differ between the trial groups. The incidence and severity of adverse events were similar in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: This placebo-controlled trial of intranasal oxytocin therapy in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder showed no significant between-group differences in the least-squares mean change from baseline on measures of social or cognitive functioning over a period of 24 weeks.

Drawing on a study that involved over 150 families in the USA and the UK, I show that children are able to report threats to authenticity, but that the majority of children are not concerned with such threats. On balance, children report that stimulants improve their capacity for moral agency, and they associate this capacity with an ability to meet normative expectations. I argue that although under certain conditions stimulant drug treatment may increase the risk of a threat to authenticity, there are ways to minimise this risk and to maximise the benefits of stimulant drug treatment. Medical professionals in particular should help children to flourish with stimulant drug treatments, in good and in bad conditions.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: No study in Greece has assessed so far the full range of common mental disorders using a representative sample of the population from both mainland and insular regions of the country. The aim of the present paper was to present the results of the first such study. METHODS: The study was carried out between 2009-2010 in a nationally representative sample of 4894 individuals living in private households in Greece. Common mental disorders in the past week were assessed with the revised Clinical Interview Schedule (CIS-R). We also assessed alcohol use disorders (using AUDIT), smoking and cannabis use. RESULTS: 14\% of the population (Male: 11\%, Female: 17\%) was found to have clinically significant psychiatric morbidity according to the scores on the CIS-R. The prevalence (past seven days) of specific common mental disorders was as follows: Generalized Anxiety Disorder: 4.10\% (95\% CI: 3.54, 4.65); Depression: 2.90\% (2.43, 3.37); Panic Disorder: 1.88\% (1.50, 2.26); Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder: 1.69\% (1.33, 2.05); All Phobias: 2.79\% (2.33, 3.26); Mixed anxiety-depression: 2.67\% (2.22, 3.12). Harmful alcohol use was reported by 12.69\% of the population (11.75, 13.62). Regular smoking was reported by 39.60\% of the population (38.22, 40.97) while cannabis use (at least once during the past month) by 2.06\% (1.66, 2.46). Clinically significant psychiatric morbidity was positively associated with the following variables: female gender, divorced or widowed family status, low educational status and unemployment. Use of all substances was more common in men compared to women. Common mental disorders were often comorbid, undertreated, and associated with a lower quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the present study can help in the better planning and development of mental health services in Greece, especially in a time of mental health budget restrictions.},

Consistently noted alongside these symptoms is mood instability in the form of irritability, volatility, swift changes in mood, hot temper and low frustration tolerance. The current diagnostic classification systems do not include mood instability as a core aspect of ADHD, but rather as an associated feature of the disorder. However, the literature suggests that overlapping cognitive deficits and neuroanatomical substrates may underlie both the classical ADHD symptoms and mood instability. Furthermore, common neurotherapeutic interventions in the form of stimulant medications or atomoxetine may help to alleviate both types of symptoms when they co-occur. This research suggests that mood instability and symptoms of ADHD may be interlinked and that mood instability may be better understood as a core feature of the ADHD syndrome.}

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Although much has been learned about road rage among adults, data on road rage experiences among adolescents has not been available previously. We examine the prevalence and demographic correlates of road rage victimization based on a population survey of Ontario students. METHODS: Based on the 2005 Ontario Student Drug Use Survey, a self-administered survey of Ontario students in grades 7-12 (n = 7726), the contribution of demographic factors (gender, region, driver's license status, grade, overall marks) to three road rage victimization measures was examined with logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Just over half of students (53.2\%) had been victims of shouts, curses and rude gestures in the past year, 8.9\% were threatened with damage to their vehicle or personal injury and 6.2\% experienced an attempt or actual damage to their vehicle or personal injury. Logistic regression analyses revealed that being a victim of shouting was significantly related to region, driver's license status, and grade. Victimization by threats was significantly related to gender, driver's license, grade, and marks. Being a victim of attempts or actual vehicle damage or injury was significantly related to region, driver's license, and marks. CONCLUSION: This study provides the first indication of prevalence of road rage victimization among adolescents. Road rage victimization in its milder form is common, involving just over half of Ontario students in grades 7-12. About 1 in 10 students were threatened with vehicle damage or personal injury, and about 1 in 20 were victims of attempts or actual damage or injury.},

  abstract = {Background Interest in and use of co-production in healthcare services and research is growing. Previous reviews have summarized co-production approaches in use, collated outcomes and effects of co-production, and focused on replicability and reporting, but none have critically reflected on how co-production in applied health research might be evolving and the implications of this for future research. We conducted this scoping review to systematically map recent literature on co-production in applied health research in the United Kingdom to inform co-production practice and guide future methodological research. Methods This scoping review was performed using established methods. We created an evidence map to show the extent and nature of the literature on co-production and applied health research, based on which we described the characteristics of the articles and scope of the literature and summarized conceptualizations of co-production and how it was implemented. We extracted implications for co-production practice or future research and conducted a content analysis of this information to identify lessons for the practice of co-production and themes for future methodological research. Results Nineteen articles reporting co-produced complex interventions and 64 reporting co-production in applied health research met the inclusion criteria. Lessons for the practice of co-production and requirements for co-production to become more embedded in organizational structures included (1) the capacity to implement co-produced interventions, (2) the skill set needed for co-production, (3) multiple levels of engagement and negotiation, and (4) funding and institutional arrangements for meaningful co-production. Themes for future research on co-production included (1) who to involve in co-production and how, (2) evaluating outcomes of co-production, (3) the language and practice of co-production, (4) documenting costs and challenges, and (5) vital components or best practice for co-production. Conclusion Researchers are operationalizing co-production in various ways, often without the necessary financial and organizational support required and the right conditions for success. We argue for accepting the diversity in approaches to co-production, call on researchers to be clearer in their reporting of these approaches, and make suggestions for what researchers should record. To support co-production of research, changes to entrenched academic and scientific practices are needed., Protocol registration details: The protocol for the scoping review was registered with protocols.io on 19 October 2021: https://dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.by7epzje.

  abstract = {Our contemporary societies place more and more emphasis on the singular and the unique. The industrial societies of the early 20th century produced standardized products, cities, subjects and organizations which tended to look the same, but in our late-modern societies, we value the exceptional - unique objects, experiences, places, individuals, events and communities which are beyond the ordinary and which claim a certain authenticity. Industrial societys logic of the general has been replaced by late modernitys logic of the particular. In this major new book, Andreas Reckwitz examines the causes, structures and consequences of the society of singularities in which we now live. The transformation from industrial to cultural capitalism, the rise of digital technologies and their culture machine and the emergence of an educated, urban new middle class form a powerful engine for the singularization of the social. In late modernity, what is singular is valorized and stirs the emotions, while what is general has to remain in the background, and this has profound social consequences. The society of singularities systematically produces devaluation and inequality: winner-takes-all markets, job polarization, the neglect of rural regions and the alienation of the traditional middle class. The emergence of populism and the rise of aggressive forms of nationalism which emphasize the cultural authenticity of ones own people thus turn out to be the other side of singularization. This prize-winning book offers a new perspective on how modern societies have changed in recent decades and it will be of great value to anyone interested in the forces that are shaping our world today.},

However, the range and peak ages at onset for mental disorders are not fully established. To provide robust, global epidemiological estimates of age at onset for mental disorders, we conducted a PRISMA/MOOSE-compliant systematic review with meta-analysis of birth cohort/cross-sectional/cohort studies, representative of the general population, reporting age at onset for any ICD/DSM-mental disorders, identified in PubMed/Web of Science (up to 16/05/2020) (PROSPERO:CRD42019143015). Co-primary outcomes were the proportion of individuals with onset of mental disorders before age 14, 18, 25, and peak age at onset, for any mental disorder and across International~Classification of~Diseases~11 diagnostic~blocks.~Median age at onset of~specific~disorders was additionally investigated.~Across 192 studies (n\,=\,708,561)~included, the proportion of individuals with onset of any mental disorders before the~ages of~14, 18, 25~were 34.6\%, 48.4\%, 62.5\%, and peak age was~14.5 years (k\,=\,14, median\,=\,18, interquartile range (IQR)\,=\,11-34). For diagnostic blocks, the proportion of individuals with onset of disorder before the age of 14, 18, 25 and peak age were as follows: neurodevelopmental disorders: 61.5\%, 83.2\%, 95.8\%, 5.5 years (k\,=\,21, median=12, IQR\,=\,7-16), anxiety/fear-related disorders: 38.1\%, 51.8\%, 73.3\%, 5.5 years (k\,=\,73, median\,=\,17, IQR\,=\,9-25), obsessive-compulsive/related disorders: 24.6\%, 45.1\%, 64.0\%, 14.5 years (k\,=\,20, median\,=\,19, IQR\,=\,14-29), feeding/eating disorders/problems: 15.8\%, 48.1\%, 82.4\%, 15.5 years (k\,=\,11, median\,=\,18, IQR\,=\,15-23), conditions specifically associated with stress disorders: 16.9\%, 27.6\%, 43.1\%, 15.5 years (k\,=\,16, median\,=\,30, IQR\,=\,17-48), substance use disorders/addictive behaviours: 2.9\%, 15.2\%, 48.8\%, 19.5 years (k\,=\,58, median\,=\,25, IQR\,=\,20-41), schizophrenia-spectrum disorders/primary psychotic states: 3\%, 12.3\%, 47.8\%, 20.5 years (k\,=\,36, median\,=\,25, IQR\,=\,20-34), personality disorders/related traits: 1.9\%, 9.6\%, 47.7\%, 20.5 years (k\,=\,6, median\,=\,25, IQR\,=\,20-33), and mood disorders: 2.5\%, 11.5\%, 34.5\%, 20.5 years (k\,=\,79, median\,=\,31, IQR\,=\,21-46).

This self-report measure was designed to evaluate symptoms relating to separation anxiety, social phobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic-agoraphobia, generalized anxiety, and fears of physical injury. Results of confirmatory and exploratory factor analyses supported six factors consistent with the hypothesized subtypes of anxiety. There was support also for a model in which the first-order factors loaded significantly on a single second-order factor of anxiety in general. The internal consistency of the total score and sub-scales was high, and 12-week test--retest reliability was satisfactory. The SCAS correlated strongly with a frequently used child self-report measure of anxiety and significantly, albeit at a lower level, with a measure of depression.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is one of the most common mental disorders; however, there is no brief clinical measure for assessing GAD. The objective of this study was to develop a brief self-report scale to identify probable cases of GAD and evaluate its reliability and validity. METHODS: A criterion-standard study was performed in 15 primary care clinics in the United States from November 2004 through June 2005. Of a total of 2740 adult patients completing a study questionnaire, 965 patients had a telephone interview with a mental health professional within 1 week. For criterion and construct validity, GAD self-report scale diagnoses were compared with independent diagnoses made by mental health professionals; functional status measures; disability days; and health care use. RESULTS: A 7-item anxiety scale (GAD-7) had good reliability, as well as criterion, construct, factorial, and procedural validity. A cut point was identified that optimized sensitivity (89\%) and specificity (82\%). Increasing scores on the scale were strongly associated with multiple domains of functional impairment (all 6 Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form General Health Survey scales and disability days). Although GAD and depression symptoms frequently co-occurred, factor analysis confirmed them as distinct dimensions. Moreover, GAD and depression symptoms had differing but independent effects on functional impairment and disability. There was good agreement between self-report and interviewer-administered versions of the scale. CONCLUSION: The GAD-7 is a valid and efficient tool for screening for GAD and assessing its severity in clinical practice and research.},

We wanted to discuss how co-production could work in research, how it could be seen as business as usual, and to think through the barriers that stop us from working together, as well as the things that can help us move forward. While we agreed that the idea of working together is important, we recognised there are still many challenges to co-production being seen as a normal activity in research and the development of a `business case' to persuade others is still needed. We also considered the wider civic roles that Universities are adopting as important in helping co-production become normal practice. Discussion focused on issues such as power and how it works in research. We recognised that we also need to create the right conditions for co-production, changing research culture so it becomes kinder, with a focus on the development of relationships. We also recognised the need for enough time for honest, high quality conversations between patients, public contributors and researchers that take account of how power works in research. Co-production was seen as a societal `good,' helping us live well by undertaking research together that benefits the health of the public. We also identified a range of ways we could move co-production forward, recognising we are on a journey and that current societal changes brought about by Covid-19 may result in us being more radical in how we rethink the ways we want to work in research.},

  abstract = {Using a theory of emotional understanding, the basis for distinguishing among happiness, anger, and sadness was investigated. Three and six-year-old children and adults predicted and explained people's emotional responses to different types of events. The events varied as to whether a person's goal was to attain or to avoid a state, whether the goal was achieved or not, who or what was responsible for success or failure, and whether the outcome was intentional or accidental. For all groups, the attainment and maintenance of goals was the primary focus of explanations for emotions and for the plans that followed emotions. A distinct set of features was used to infer and explain happiness as opposed to anger and sadness. Happiness was elicited by goal success and was followed by plans to maintain or enjoy current goal states. Anger and sadness were elicited by goal failure and were followed by plans to reinstate, replace, or forfeit goals. Anger occurred more frequently than sadness when an aversive rather than a loss state occurred, when an animate agent rather than a natural event caused a negative outcome, and when attention was focused on the cause rather than the consequence of goal failure. Two dimensions associated with anger changed as a function of age. First grade children, and adults were more likely than preschool children to predict anger in response to intentional harm, and their explanations for anger were more likely to refer to the agent or cause of goal failure. For all age groups, however, the majority of subjects responded to aversive situations with anger responses, independent of the causal conditions that produced the aversive state. The results therefore indicate that anger can be produced without intentional harm, but that intentional harm becomes an important dimension in attributing anger, especially as a function of development.}

This has led to interest in SAD as a possible modifier of the risk and/or course of mood disorders.Data come from a prospective, longitudinal epidemiologic study of adolescents and young adults (aged 14-24 years) in Munich, Germany. Respondent diagnoses (N = 2548) at baseline and follow-up (34-50 months later) are considered. The influence of SAD at baseline on the risk, course, and characteristics of depressive disorders (ie, major depression or dysthymia) at follow-up is examined.The baseline prevalence of SAD was 7.2\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 6.1\%-8.4\%). Social anxiety disorder in nondepressed persons at baseline was associated with an increased likelihood (odds ratio [OR] = 3.5; 95\% CI, 2.0-6.0) of depressive disorder onset during the follow-up period. Furthermore, comorbid SAD and depressive disorder at baseline was associated with a worse prognosis (compared with depressive disorder without comorbid SAD at baseline). This is exemplified by the greater likelihood of depressive disorder persistence or recurrence (OR = 2.3; 95\% CI, 1.2-4.6) and attempted suicide (OR = 6.1; 95\% CI, 1.2-32.2).Social anxiety disorder during adolescence or young adulthood is an important predictor of subsequent depressive disorders. Moreover, the presence of comorbid SAD in adolescents who are already depressed is associated with a more malignant course and character of subsequent depressive illness.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Parental depression is common and is a major risk factor for depression in adolescents. Early identification of adolescents at elevated risk of developing major depressive disorder (MDD) in this group could improve early access to preventive interventions. METHODS: Using longitudinal data from 337 adolescents at high familial risk of depression, we developed a risk prediction model for adolescent MDD. The model was externally validated in an independent cohort of 1,384 adolescents at high familial risk. We assessed predictors at baseline and MDD at follow-up (a median of 2-3\,years later). We compared the risk prediction model to a simple comparison model based on screening for depressive symptoms. Decision curve analysis was used to identify which model-predicted risk score thresholds were associated with the greatest clinical benefit. RESULTS: The MDD risk prediction model discriminated between those adolescents who did and did not develop MDD in the development (C-statistic\,=\,.783, IQR (interquartile range)\,=\,.779, .778) and the validation samples (C-statistic\,=\,.722, IQR\,=\,-.694, .741). Calibration in the validation sample was good to excellent (calibration intercept\,=\,.011, C-slope\,=\,.851). The MDD risk prediction model was superior to the simple comparison model where discrimination was no better than chance (C-statistic\,=\,.544, IQR\,=\,.536, .572). Decision curve analysis found that the highest clinical utility was at the lowest risk score thresholds (0.01-0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The developed risk prediction model successfully discriminated adolescents who developed MDD from those who did not. In practice, this model could be further developed with user involvement into a tool to target individuals for low-intensity, selective preventive intervention.},

There is increasing interest in its potential for application in adolescents, and previous research has demonstrated that it shows good construct validity here. This article further examines its practicality and validity in adolescents by comparing it with KIDSCREEN-10, a short generic measure for assessing children and adolescents' health-related quality of life and well-being. METHODS: A Web-based survey, including the CHU9D, a general health question, questions on the presence of long-standing illness, disability, or medical conditions, sociodemographic variables, and KIDSCREEN-10, was administered to 961 consenting adolescents. The practicality and face and construct validity of the CHU9D were examined, and the CHU9D and KIDSCREEN-10 were compared in terms of their coverage, correlations between dimensions, and overall scores. RESULTS: Both measures demonstrated good practicality and validity. The strongest degree of correlation was found with the only dimension in common for the CHU9D and KIDSCREEN (sad). The lowest correlations were found between all the CHU9D dimensions and the "have you had enough time for yourself" dimension of KIDSCREEN-10. CONCLUSIONS: The findings from this study provide further support for the practicality and validity of the application of the CHU9D in the economic evaluation of adolescent health care and public health programs. Further research to test the psychometric performance of the CHU9D in more diverse clinical samples of adolescents is desirable including tests of reliability.},

Population               232 randomized, double blind, placebo controlled trials of drug monotherapy for major depressive disorder submitted by drug developers to the FDA between 1979 and 2016, comprising 73\,388 adult and child participants meeting the inclusion criteria for efficacy studies on antidepressants.                                         Main outcome measures               Responses were converted to Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD17) equivalent scores where other measures were used to assess efficacy. Multivariable analyses examined the effects of age, sex, baseline severity, and year of the study on improvements in depressive symptoms in the antidepressant and placebo groups. Response distributions were analyzed with finite mixture models.                                         Results                                The random effects mean difference between drug and placebo favored drug (1.75 points, 95\% confidence interval 1.63 to 1.86). Differences between drug and placebo increased significantly (P{$<$}0.001) with greater baseline severity. After controlling for participant characteristics at baseline, no trends in treatment effect or placebo response over time were found. The best fitting model of response distributions was three normal distributions, with mean improvements from baseline to end of treatment of 16.0, 8.9, and 1.7 points. These distributions were designated Large, Non-specific, and Minimal responses, respectively. Participants who were treated with a drug were more likely to have a Large response (24.5\%                 v                 9.6\%) and less likely to have a Minimal response (12.2.\%                 v                 21.5\%).                                                        Conclusions               The trimodal response distributions suggests that about 15\% of participants have a substantial antidepressant effect beyond a placebo effect in clinical trials, highlighting the need for predictors of meaningful responses specific to drug treatment.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Irritability is a widely occurring DSM-IV symptom in youths. However, little is known about the relationship between irritability in early life and its outcomes in mid-adulthood. This study examines the extent to which youth irritability is related to adult psychiatric outcomes by testing the hypothesis that it predicts depressive and generalized anxiety disorders. METHOD: The authors conducted a longitudinal community-based study of 631 participants whose parents were interviewed when participants were in early adolescence (mean age=13.8 years [SD=2.6]) and who were themselves interviewed 20 years later (mean age=33.2 years [SD=2.9]). Parent-reported irritability in adolescence was used to predict self-reported psychopathology, assessed by standardized diagnostic interview at 20-year follow-up. RESULTS: Cross-sectionally, irritability in adolescence was widely associated with other psychiatric disorders. After adjustment for baseline emotional and behavioral disorders, irritability in adolescence predicted major depressive disorder (odds ratio=1.33, 95\% confidence interval [CI]=1.00-1.78]), generalized anxiety disorder (odds ratio=1.72, 95\% CI=1.04-2.87), and dysthymia (odds ratio=1.81, 95\% CI=1.06-3.12) at 20-year follow-up. Youth irritability did not predict bipolar disorder or axis II disorders at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Youth irritability as reported by parents is a specific predictor of self-reported depressive and anxiety disorders 20 years later. The role of irritability in developmental psychiatry, and in the pathophysiology of mood and anxiety disorders specifically, should receive further study.},

Here, we present data from two samples, one from the United States and the other from the United Kingdom, demonstrating the clinical and research utility of the parent- and self-report forms of the Affective Reactivity Index (ARI), a concise dimensional measure of irritability. Methods: The US sample (n = 218) consisted of children and adolescents recruited at the National Institute of Mental Health meeting criteria for bipolar disorder (BD, n = 39), severe mood dysregulation (SMD, n = 67), children at family risk for BD (n = 35), or were healthy volunteers (n = 77). The UK sample (n = 88) was comprised of children from a generic mental health setting and healthy volunteers from primary and secondary schools. Results: Parent- and self-report scales of the ARI showed excellent internal consistencies and formed a single factor in the two samples. In the US sample, the ARI showed a gradation with irritability significantly increasing from healthy volunteers through to SMD. Irritability was significantly higher in SMD than in BD by parent-report, but this did not reach significance by self-report. In the UK sample, parent-rated irritability was differentially related to emotional problems. Conclusions: Irritability can be measured using a concise instrument both in a highly specialized US, as well as a general UK child mental health setting.},

Adolescents with current subthreshold depression and clinical depression were compared with matched healthy subjects. In addition, BOLD responses were compared across adolescents with anhedonia, low mood, or both symptoms, cross-sectionally and longitudinally. RESULTS: Activity in the ventral striatum was reduced in participants with subthreshold and clinical depression relative to healthy comparison subjects. Low ventral striatum activation predicted transition to subthreshold or clinical depression in previously healthy adolescents at 2-year follow-up. Brain responses during reward anticipation decreased in a graded manner between healthy adolescents, adolescents with current or future subthreshold depression, and adolescents with current or future clinical depression. Low ventral striatum activity was associated with anhedonia but not low mood; however, the combined presence of both symptoms showed the strongest reductions in the ventral striatum in all analyses. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that reduced striatal activation operates as a mechanism across the risk spectrum for depression. It is associated with anhedonia in healthy adolescents and is a behavioral indicator of positive valence systems, consistent with predictions based on the Research Domain Criteria.},

We found that a substantial proportion of children screened positive for having episodes of "going high" and were at an increased risk for morbidity and impairment. Using factor analysis, we identified that episodic mania-like symptoms comprised two dimensions: An under-controlled dimension that was associated with significant impairment, and a low-risk exuberant dimension. Using latent class analysis, we identified a small group of children scoring high on a range of manic symptoms and suffering from severe psychosocial impairment and morbidity. Our results carry implications for the nosology and psychosocial impairment associated with episodic mood changes in young people.},

We test the hypothesis that oppositionality encompasses an Irritable, a Headstrong, and a Hurtful dimension, each with distinct predictions. METHOD: Longitudinal design combining data from two British national surveys and their respective 3-year follow-ups (N = 7,912). The Developmental and Well-Being Assessment was used to generate DSM-IV diagnoses. RESULTS: The Irritable dimension was the sole predictor of emotional disorders at follow-up and was particularly associated with distress disorders (depression and anxiety) rather than fear disorders (phobias, separation anxiety, and panic disorder), both before and after adjustment for baseline psychopathology. The Headstrong dimension was the only predictor of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder at follow-up. Both Headstrong and Hurtful predicted conduct disorder, although only the Headstrong dimension did so after adjustment for baseline psychopathology. The Hurtful dimension was the strongest predictor of aggressive conduct disorder symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest a developmental model of mental disorder whereby oppositionality is an interim shared manifestation of different dimensions of psychopathology with distinct outcomes.},

We sought to establish the occurrence and importance of mood lability in a large community sample of children and adolescents by testing a priori hypotheses. METHOD: Cross-sectional data were taken from a national mental health survey including 5326 subjects aged 8-19 years in the UK. The outcomes were prevalence and characteristics of mood lability and its associations with psychopathology and overall impairment. RESULTS: Mood lability occurred in more than 5\% of the population of children and adolescents, both by parent and self-report. Mood lability was strongly associated with a wide range of psychopathology and was linked to significant impairment even in the absence of psychiatric disorders. Mood lability was particularly strongly associated with co-morbidity between internalizing and externalizing disorders, even when adjusting for the association with individual disorders. The pattern of results did not change after excluding youth with bipolar disorder or with episodes of elated mood. CONCLUSIONS: Clinically significant mood lability is relatively common in the community. Our findings indicate that mood lability is not a mere consequence of other psychopathology in that it is associated with significant impairment even in the absence of psychiatric diagnoses. Moreover, the pattern of association of mood lability with co-morbidity suggests that it could be a risk factor shared by both internalizing and externalizing disorders. Our data point to the need for greater awareness of mood lability and its implications for treatment.},

However, there is relatively little research on impact and its association with symptoms. This paper examines how well impact can be measured and how it relates to psychiatric outcomes. On four separate occasions over 3 years, symptoms and impact were assessed in a UK epidemiological sample (n\,=\,4,479; 51.5 \% boys) using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) as reported by parents, youths and teachers. Disorders were ascertained using the Development and Well-Being Assessment. An impact scale made of items about distress and impairment demonstrated considerable internal consistency, cross-informant correlations, and longitudinal stability by all reporting sources. Impact at baseline was a strong predictor of psychiatric disorder 3 years later after accounting for psychiatric disorders and symptoms measured at baseline: odds ratio OR\,=\,2.10, 95 \% Confidence Interval (CI) [1.50, 2.94] according to parent-rated impact and OR\,=\,1.71, CI [1.08, 2.72] according to teacher-rated impact. Changes in impact over time were predicted, but not fully accounted for, by symptoms measured at baseline. Impact can be reliably and easily measured across time, and it may be clinically useful as an independent predictor of future symptoms and psychiatric disorders. More studies are needed to understand inter-individual variation in the impact caused by equivalent symptoms.},

The reasons for these associations are unclear. Here we test the hypothesis that two distinct early temperamental precursors-emotionality and activity-underlie ODD and differentially predict its comorbidities. METHOD: The Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) community-based representative sample was used. Temperamental dimensions at the age of 38 months were derived through exploratory factor analysis from the Emotionality Activity Sociability (EAS) scale and used in logistic regression predicting to psychiatric diagnoses at the age of 91 months. RESULTS: Pure ODD was predicted by both emotionality (relative risk ratio [RRR] = 1.34, CI = 1.09 to 1.66) and activity (RRR = 1.39, CI = 1.07 to 1.81). The strongest predictions were from early temperament to ODD with comorbidity: from emotionality to ODD plus internalizing disorders (RRR = 3.33, CI = 2.14 to 5.19), and from activity to ODD plus ADHD (RRR = 3.24, CI = 1.48 to 7.11). Temperamental activity was a predictor of the hyperactive-impulsive and combined types of ADHD but not of the inattentive type. CONCLUSIONS: Classified as a disruptive disorder, ODD is predicted by early emotion dysregulation as well as by high levels of temperamental activity. The findings of this study suggest that early emotionality and activity differentially contribute to the phenotype of ODD in middle childhood and may determine its range of co-occurrence with other psychopathology. Taking into account the heterogeneous origins of childhood oppositionality may help to refine clinical approaches to ODD.},

More recent conceptualisations of interoception incorporate interoceptive attention and higher-order measures related to the interpretation of interoceptive signals. At present, these interoceptive dimensions are largely assessed in isolation, yet this fails to capture the complexity of interoception. Comprehensive assessment across interoceptive dimensions can determine the full operation of general interoceptive function. Current work suggests that these interoceptive processes may be dissociable across dimensions and bodily axes, with differential mapping to cognitive and emotion processing. To characterise differences in interoceptive profiles, all interoceptive dimensions can be assessed within individuals, both within a single bodily axis (e.g., cardiac) or across bodily axes. Future work can better delineate how these interoceptive measures correspond to different types of processing. Comprehensive interoceptive assessment can help isolate selective interoceptive disruptions in different clinical conditions.},

We have used this refined phenotype (ADHD-Combined Type without internalizing comorbidities) in our molecular genetic studies of ADHD, which have paralleled the emerging literature in this new field. In our research program, we used the candidate gene approach, with hypotheses derived from the dopamine theory of ADHD and Posner and Raichle's (1994) theory of attention. We proposed a candidate dopamine gene (DRD4) and discovered an association with ADHD due to an increase prevalence of the `7-repeat' allele defined by a 48-base-pair variable number of tandem repeats in exon III. The DRD4--ADHD association has now been confirmed by multiple groups around the world. In the next steps of our research program, we are evaluating the impact of a putative DRD4 risk allele on cognition, initiating an investigation of DNA sequence variation in DRD4 alleles, and investigating the association of ADHD with other candidate genes. Using our collaborative research program as an example, we will review the history and current status of molecular genetic studies of ADHD.},

A dominant theory about this signal contends that it reflects the operation of the neural system underlying reinforcement learning in humans. The theory suggests that this frontocentral negative deflection in the ERP 230-270 ms after the delivery of a probabilistic reward expresses a prediction error signal derived from midbrain dopaminergic projections to the anterior cingulate cortex. We tested this theory by investigating whether FRN will also be observed for an inherently aversive outcome: physical pain. In another session, the outcome was monetary reward instead of pain. As predicted, unexpected reward omissions (a negative reward prediction error) yielded a more negative deflection relative to unexpected reward delivery. Surprisingly, unexpected pain omission (a positive reward prediction error) also yielded a negative deflection relative to unexpected pain delivery. Our data challenge the theory by showing that the FRN expresses aversive prediction errors with the same sign as reward prediction errors. Both FRNs were spatiotemporally and functionally equivalent. We suggest that FRN expresses salience prediction errors rather than reward prediction errors.},

  abstract = {What motivates individuals to regulate their emotions? One answer, which has been highlighted in emotion-regulation research, is that individuals are motivated by short-term hedonic goals (e.g., the motivation to feel pleasure). Another answer, however, is that individuals are motivated by instrumental goals (e.g., the motivation to perform certain behaviors). We suggest that both answers have merit. To demonstrate the role instrumental goals may play in emotion regulation, we pitted short-term hedonic motives and instrumental motives against each other, by testing whether individuals were motivated to experience a potentially useful, albeit unpleasant, emotion. We found that (a) individuals preferred activities that would increase their level of anger (but not their level of excitement) when they were anticipating confrontational, but not nonconfrontational, tasks and that (b) anger improved performance in a confrontational, but not a nonconfrontational, task. These findings support a functional view of emotion regulation, and demonstrate that in certain contexts, individuals may choose to experience emotions that are instrumental, despite short-term hedonic costs.},

  abstract = {Emotion regulation involves the pursuit of desired emotional states (i.e., emotion goals) in the service of superordinate motives. The nature and consequences of emotion regulation, therefore, are likely to depend on the motives it is intended to serve. Nonetheless, limited attention has been devoted to studying what motivates emotion regulation. By mapping the potential benefits of emotion to key human motives, this review identifies key classes of motives in emotion regulation. The proposed taxonomy distinguishes between hedonic motives that target the immediate phenomenology of emotions, and instrumental motives that target other potential benefits of emotions. Instrumental motives include behavioral, epistemic, social, and eudaimonic motives. The proposed taxonomy offers important implications for understanding the mechanism of emotion regulation, variation across individuals and contexts, and psychological function and dysfunction, and points to novel research directions.},

  abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Existing therapeutic options are insufficient to tackle the disease burden of depression, and new treatments are sorely needed. Defining new psychotherapeutic targets is challenging given the paucity of coherent mechanistic explanations for depression. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether mood homeostasis (ie, the stabilization of one's mood by engaging in mood-modifying activities) is a possible new therapeutic target by testing the hypothesis that people with low (vs high) mean mood and people with (vs without) a history of depression have impaired mood homeostasis. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The quantitative association between mood and daily activities was computed in 2 large case-control studies based on the 58sec data set (collected from December 1, 2012, to May 31, 2014, and analyzed from April 1 to 30, 2019), and the World Health Organization Study on Global Aging and Adult Health (WHO SAGE) data set (collected from January 1, 2007, to December 31, 2010, and analyzed from June 1 to 30, 2019). The 58sec data set consists of self-enrolled participants from high-income countries. The WHO SAGE data set consists of nationally representative participants in low- and middle-income countries recruited via cluster sampling. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcome (defined before data analysis) was the difference in mood homeostasis between people with high vs low mean mood (58sec data) and between people with vs without a history of depression (WHO SAGE data). RESULTS: A total of 28\,212 participants from the 58sec data set (65.8\% female; mean [SD] age, 28.1 [9.0] years) and 30\,116 from the WHO SAGE data set (57.0\% female; mean [SD] age, 57.8 [14.7] years) were included, for an overall study population of 58 328 participants. Mood homeostasis was significantly lower in people with low (vs high) mean mood (0.63 [95\% CI, 0.45 to 0.79] vs 0.96 [95\% CI, 0.96 to 0.98]; P\,{$<$}\,.001) and in people with (vs without) a history of depression (0.03 [95\% CI, -0.26 to 0.24] vs 0.68 [95\% CI, 0.55 to 0.75]; P\,{$<$}\,.001). In dynamic simulations, lower mood homeostasis led to more depressive episodes (11.8\% vs 3.8\% yearly risk; P\,{$<$}\,.001) that lasted longer (4.19 vs 2.90 weeks; P\,=\,.006). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, mood homeostasis appeared to have been impaired in people with low mood and in those with a history of depression. Mood homeostasis may therefore provide new insights to guide the development of treatments for depression.},

However, the underlying pathological mechanisms are not yet fully understood. This study aimed to estimate heritability of HRV and BP and to determine their genetic overlap. We used baseline data of the 3-generation Lifelines population-based cohort study (n=149\,067; mean age, 44.5). In-house software was used to calculate root mean square of successive differences and SD of normal-to-normal intervals as indices of HRV based on 10-second resting ECGs. BP was recorded with an automatic BP monitor. We estimated heritabilities and genetic correlations with variance components methods in ASReml software. We additionally estimated genetic correlations with bivariate linkage disequilibrium score regression using publicly available genome-wide association study data. The heritability (SE) estimates were 15.6\% (0.90\%) for SD of normal-to-normal intervals and 17.9\% (0.90\%) for root mean square of successive differences. For BP measures, they ranged from 24.4\% (0.90\%) for pulse pressure to 30.3\% (0.90\%) for diastolic BP. Significant negative genetic correlations (all P{$<$}0.0001) of root mean square of successive differences/SD of normal-to-normal intervals with systolic BP (-0.20/-0.16) and with diastolic BP (-0.15/-0.13) were observed. LD score regression showed largely consistent genetic correlation estimates of root mean square of successive differences/SD of normal-to-normal intervals with systolic BP (range, -0.08 to -0.23) and diastolic BP (range, -0.20 to -0.27). Our study shows a substantial contribution of genetic factors in explaining the variance of HRV and BP measures in the general population. The significant negative genetic correlations between HRV and BP indicate that genetic pathways for HRV and BP partially overlap.},

  abstract = {Capturing individual differences in cognition is central to human neuroscience. Yet our ability to estimate cognitive abilities via brain MRI is still poor in both prediction and reliability. Our study tested if this inability can be improved by integrating MRI signals across the whole brain and across modalities, including task-based functional MRI (tfMRI) of different tasks along with other non-task MRI modalities, such as structural MRI, resting-state functional connectivity. Using the Human Connectome Project (n=873, 473 females, after quality control), we directly compared predictive models comprising different sets of MRI modalities (e.g., seven tasks vs. non-task modalities). We applied two approaches to integrate multimodal MRI, stacked vs. flat models, and implemented 16 combinations of machine-learning algorithms. The stacked model integrating all modalities via stacking Elastic Net provided the best prediction (r=.57), relatively to other models tested, as well as excellent test-retest reliability (ICC={$\sim$}.85) in capturing general cognitive abilities. Importantly, compared to the stacked model integrating across non-task modalities (r=.27), the stacked model integrating tfMRI across tasks led to significantly higher prediction (r=.56) while still providing excellent test-retest reliability (ICC={$\sim$}.83). The stacked model integrating tfMRI across tasks was driven by frontal and parietal areas and by tasks that are cognition-related (working-memory, relational processing, and language). This result is consistent with the parieto-frontal integration theory of intelligence. Accordingly, our results contradict the recently popular notion that tfMRI is not reliable enough to capture individual differences in cognition. Instead, our study suggests that tfMRI, when used appropriately (i.e., by drawing information across the whole brain and across tasks and by integrating with other modalities), provides predictive and reliable sources of information for individual differences in cognitive abilities, more so than non-task modalities.},

The incidence, notably in girls, rises sharply after puberty and, by the end of adolescence, the 1 year prevalence rate exceeds 4\%. The burden is highest in low-income and middle-income countries. Depression is associated with substantial present and future morbidity, and heightens suicide risk. The strongest risk factors for depression in adolescents are a family history of depression and exposure to psychosocial stress. Inherited risks, developmental factors, sex hormones, and psychosocial adversity interact to increase risk through hormonal factors and associated perturbed neural pathways. Although many similarities between depression in adolescence and depression in adulthood exist, in adolescents the use of antidepressants is of concern and opinions about clinical management are divided. Effective treatments are available, but choices are dependent on depression severity and available resources. Prevention strategies targeted at high-risk groups are promising.},

Adverse outcomes associated with depression in young people include depression recurrence; the onset of other psychiatric disorders; and wider, protracted impairments in interpersonal, social, educational, and occupational functioning. Thus, prevention and early intervention for depression in young people are priorities. Preventive and early intervention strategies typically target predisposing factors, antecedents, and symptoms of depression. Young people who have a family history of depression, exposure to social stressors (eg, bullying, discordant relationships, or stressful life events), and belong to certain subgroups (eg, having a chronic physical health problem or being a sexual minority) are at especially high risk of depression. Clinical antecedents include depressive symptoms, anxiety, and irritability. Evidence favours indicated prevention and targeted prevention to universal prevention. Emerging school-based and community-based social interventions show some promise. Depression is highly heterogeneous; therefore, a stepwise treatment approach is recommended, starting with brief psychosocial interventions, then a specific psychological therapy, and then an antidepressant medication.},

Three process variables (self-focused attention, negative social cognitions, and depressed mood) were examined using multilevel structural equation models. RESULTS: Significant indirect effects were observed for all three variables in both samples, with negative social cognitions showing the strongest percent mediation effect. 'Reversed' relationships, where social anxiety predicted subsequent process variable scores, were also supported.

Objective This waitlist-controlled study evaluated the efficacy of a UK-developed, therapist-guided internet Cognitive Therapy programme for Social Anxiety Disorder (iCT-SAD) when delivered in Hong Kong by local therapists. Methods Patients were randomized to iCT-SAD (n~=~22) or a waitlist control group (n~=~22). Assessments took place at weeks 0, 8, and 15 (posttreatment/postwait), with a further 3-month follow-up assessment for the iCT-SAD group. The primary outcome measure was the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (self-report), and posttreatment/postwait diagnostic assessments were completed by independent assessors blind to condition. Trial Registration: ISRCTN11357117. Results Compared with the waitlist group, iCT-SAD significantly reduced social anxiety symptoms (adjusted difference at posttreatment 55.36, 95\%CI 44.32 to 66.39, p~{$<~$}0.001; dCohen 2.41). The treatment was also superior to waitlist on all secondary outcome measures. 86\% of the iCT-SAD group demonstrated remission from SAD based on the LSAS, compared to 5\% of the waitlist group. 73\% no longer met diagnostic criteria at posttreatment, compared to 9\% of the waitlist group. The gains made by the iCT-SAD group were maintained at three-month follow-up. Conclusions iCT-SAD showed strong efficacy for the treatment of SAD in Hong Kong. As the clinical outcomes were similar to UK studies, this suggests the dissemination of the treatment into a different cultural setting did not result in a substantial loss of efficacy.},

  abstract = {Research on the development of emotions and their functional characteristics as regulators of behavior has grown dramatically over the past 10 years. There is currently renewed emphasis on the importance of emotion regulation and dysregulation for our understanding of normal development and the development of psychopathology. The 11 essays that constitute this Monograph survey theoretical, conceptual, and methodological issues involved in the study of emotion regulation, placing particular emphasis on the role that physiological systems play in the regulation of emotion and on the interface of a biological and a behavioral perspective. The Monograph is divided into three parts. Part 1 contains essays on the definitional issues involved in the study of emotion regulation. Kagan and Thompson attempt to define exactly what phenomenon it is that we are interested in studying. Kagan argues for a descriptive approach to studying emotional behavior, one in which psychological labels are put aside until there is a clear understanding of the behavioral pattern. Thompson provides a thorough review of the possible topics to be studied under the rubric of emotion regulation and emphasizes the importance of context for studying these phenomena. Both authors provide guidelines for approaching the study of emotional behaviors during development. Calkins outlines the influence that individual differences in emotion expression have on emotion regulation. She addresses the role of temperament and temperament/environment interactions and their effect on the development of emotion regulation. Cole, Michel, and Teti deal with the role that emotion regulation plays in developmental psychopathology, outlining the manner in which the development of emotion regulation may become dysfunctional and lead to problem outcomes. Their essay serves as a bridge between traditional developmental work on emotion and research in developmental psychopathology. The four essays in Part 2 focus on three different physiological systems-the neuroendocrine (Stansbury and Gunnar), autonomic nervous (Porges, Doussard-Roosevelt, and Maiti), and central nervous (Dawson and Fox) systems. These essays share common approaches to the study of emotion regulation, even though each system presents novel and potentially nonoverlapping information about the behaviors in question. The reader is provided with the background necessary to understand each complex physiological system and hence to evaluate the research that is being undertaken in that area. The three essays in Part 3 consider the role of relationships as regulators of emotional behavior. Both Hofer and Field write from the perspective of developmental psychobiology, presenting evidence of the effect that relationships have on physiological systems that are important for growth and development. Cassidy discusses current attachment theory and the role that working models of attachment play in the regulation of emotion. Taken together, these 11 essays offer a particular perspective toward emotional development and emotion regulation. This perspective reflects a functionalist view of emotions and provides evidence for the role that emotions play as regulators even as they themselves are being regulated during behavioral interaction.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Despite the clinical importance of chronic and severe irritability, there is a paucity of controlled trials for its pharmacological treatment. Here, we examine the effects of adding citalopram (CTP) to methylphenidate (MPH) in the treatment of chronic severe irritability in youth using a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled design. METHOD: After a lead-in phase of open treatment with stimulant, 53 youth meeting criteria for severe mood dysregulation (SMD) were randomly assigned to receive CTP or placebo (PBO) for 8 weeks. A total of 49 participants, 48 of them (98\%) meeting disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD) criteria, were included in the intent-to-treat analysis. The primary outcome measure was the proportion of response based on improvements of irritability at the week 8 of the trial. RESULTS: At the end of the trial, a significantly higher proportion of response was seen in those participants randomly assigned to CTP+MPH compared to PBO+MPH (35\% CTP+MPH versus 6\% PBO+MPH; odds ratio~= 11.70, 95\% CI~= 2.00-68.16, p~= 0.006). However, there were no differences in functional impairment between groups at the end of the trial. No differences were found in any adverse effect between treatment groups, and no trial participant exhibited hypomanic or manic symptoms. CONCLUSION: Adjunctive CTP might be efficacious in the treatment of chronic severe irritability in youth resistant to stimulant treatment alone.

  abstract = {Emotion has a substantial influence on the cognitive processes in humans, including perception, attention, learning, memory, reasoning, and problem solving. Emotion has a particularly strong influence on attention, especially modulating the selectivity of attention as well as motivating action and behavior. This attentional and executive control is intimately linked to learning processes, as intrinsically limited attentional capacities are better focused on relevant information. Emotion also facilitates encoding and helps retrieval of information efficiently. However, the effects of emotion on learning and memory are not always univalent, as studies have reported that emotion either enhances or impairs learning and long-term memory (LTM) retention, depending on a range of factors. Recent neuroimaging findings have indicated that the amygdala and prefrontal cortex cooperate with the medial temporal lobe in an integrated manner that affords (i) the amygdala modulating memory consolidation; (ii) the prefrontal cortex mediating memory encoding and formation; and (iii) the hippocampus for successful learning and LTM retention. We also review the nested hierarchies of circular emotional control and cognitive regulation (bottom-up and top-down influences) within the brain to achieve optimal integration of emotional and cognitive processing. This review highlights a basic evolutionary approach to emotion to understand the effects of emotion on learning and memory and the functional roles played by various brain regions and their mutual interactions in relation to emotional processing. We also summarize the current state of knowledge on the impact of emotion on memory and map implications for educational settings. In addition to elucidating the memory-enhancing effects of emotion, neuroimaging findings extend our understanding of emotional influences on learning and memory processes; this knowledge may be useful for the design of effective educational curricula to provide a conducive learning environment for both traditional "live" learning in classrooms and "virtual" learning through online-based educational technologies.},

In addition, we examined effects of age, puberty, and individuals' reward sensitivity. We collected two datasets: Experiment 1 reports cross-sectional brain data from 75 participants (ages 10-25) who played a risky decision task. Experiment 2 presents a longitudinal extension in which a subset of these adolescents (n=33) was measured again 2years later. Results showed that (1) a reward-related network including VS and medial PFC was consistently activated over time, (2) the propensity to choose the risky option was related to increased reward-related activation in VS and medial PFC, and (3) longitudinal comparisons indicated that self-reported reward sensitivity was specifically related to VS activation over time. Together, these results advance our insights in the brain circuitry underlying reward processing across adolescence.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Aberrations in both neural reward processing and stress reactivity are associated with increased risk for mental illness; yet, how these two factors relate to each other remains unclear. Several studies suggest that stress exposure impacts reward function, thus increasing risk for psychopathology. However, the alternative hypothesis, in which reward dysfunction impacts stress reactivity, has been rarely examined. The current study aimed to test both hypotheses using a longitudinal design. METHODS: Participants were 38 children (23 girls; 61\%) from a prospective cohort study. A standard stress-exposure measure was collected at 7 years of age. Children performed a well-validated imaging reward paradigm at age 10, and a standardized acute psychological stress laboratory protocol was administered both at age 10 and at age 13. Structural equation modeling was used to examine bidirectional associations between stress and neural response to reward anticipation. RESULTS: Higher exposure to stressful life events at age 7 predicted lower neural response to reward anticipation in regions of the basal ganglia at age 10, which included ventral caudate, nucleus accumbens, putamen, and globus pallidus. Lower response to reward anticipation in medial prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortex predicted higher stress reactivity at age~13. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide support for bidirectional associations between stress and reward processing, in that stress may impact reward anticipation, but also in that reduced reward anticipation may increase susceptibility to stress.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Research and clinical interest in irritability have been on the rise in recent years. Yet several questions remain about the status of irritability in psychiatry, including whether irritability can be differentiated from other symptoms, whether it forms a distinct disorder, and whether it is a meaningful predictor of clinical outcomes. In this article, we try to answer these questions by reviewing the evidence on how reliably irritability can be measured and its validity. METHOD: We combine a narrative and systematic review and meta-analysis of studies. For the systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched studies in PubMed and Web of Science based on preselected criteria. A total of 163~articles were reviewed, and 24 were included. RESULTS: We found that irritability forms a distinct dimension with substantial stability across time, and that it is specifically associated with depression and anxiety in longitudinal studies. Evidence from genetic studies reveals that irritability is moderately heritable, and its overlap with depression is explained mainly by genetic factors. Behavioral and neuroimaging studies show that youth with persistent irritability exhibit altered activations in the amygdala, striatum, and frontal regions compared with age-matched healthy volunteers. Most knowledge about the treatment of irritability is based on effects of treatment on related conditions or post hoc analyses of trial data. CONCLUSION: We identify a number of research priorities including innovative experimental designs and priorities for treatment studies, and conclude with recommendations for the assessment of irritability for researchers and clinicians.},

Using positron emission tomography (PET), we showed decreased function in the brain dopamine reward pathway in adults with ADHD, which, we hypothesized, could underlie the motivation deficits in this disorder. To evaluate this hypothesis, we performed secondary analyses to assess the correlation between the PET measures of dopamine D2/D3 receptor and dopamine transporter availability (obtained with [11C]raclopride and [11C]cocaine, respectively) in the dopamine reward pathway (midbrain and nucleus accumbens) and a surrogate measure of trait motivation (assessed using the Achievement scale on the Multidimensional Personality Questionnaire or MPQ) in 45 ADHD participants and 41 controls. The Achievement scale was lower in ADHD participants than in controls (11{\textpm}5 vs 14{\textpm}3, P{$<$}0.001) and was significantly correlated with D2/D3 receptors (accumbens: r=0.39, P{$<$}0.008; midbrain: r=0.41, P{$<$}0.005) and transporters (accumbens: r=0.35, P{$<$}0.02) in ADHD participants, but not in controls. ADHD participants also had lower values in the Constraint factor and higher values in the Negative Emotionality factor of the MPQ but did not differ in the Positive Emotionality factor---and none of these were correlated with the dopamine measures. In ADHD participants, scores in the Achievement scale were also negatively correlated with symptoms of inattention (CAARS A, E and SWAN I). These findings provide evidence that disruption of the dopamine reward pathway is associated with motivation deficits in ADHD adults, which may contribute to attention deficits and supports the use of therapeutic interventions to enhance motivation in ADHD.},

METHOD: The DB-DOS is a structured clinic-based assessment designed to elicit clinically salient behaviors relevant to the diagnosis of disruptive behavior in preschoolers. Child behavior is assessed in three interactional contexts that vary by partner (parent versus examiner) and level of support provided. Twenty-one disruptive behaviors are coded within two domains: problems in Behavioral Regulation and problems in Anger Modulation. A total of 364 referred and nonreferred preschoolers participated: interrater reliability and internal consistency were assessed on a primary sample (n = 335) and test-retest reliability was assessed in a separate sample (n = 29). RESULTS: The DB-DOS demonstrated good interrater and test-retest reliability. Confirmatory factor analysis demonstrated an excellent fit of the DB-DOS multidomain model of disruptive behavior. CONCLUSIONS: The DB-DOS is a reliable observational tool for clinic-based assessment of preschool disruptive behavior. This standardized assessment method holds promise for advancing developmentally sensitive characterization of preschool psychopathology.},

The results indicated that both monetary and social rewards effectively speeded up responses for all three age groups as reward magnitude increased in the choice reaction time task. Among adolescents and adults, males exhibited faster responses in high reward than in low reward condition, while females responded equally fast in both conditions. Among children, girls responded faster to high reward than low reward condition. However, boys committed more errors than girls in low and high reward conditions, and they had exhibited more errors in high reward than that in no reward condition for social reward. Regarding the subjective ratings, both children and adolescents reported higher motivation for social reward than for monetary reward. These findings indicated that the males in the adolescent and adult groups were more sensitive to reward than were the females. Moreover, tangible and quantitative social reward had stronger incentive power than monetary reward among children and adolescents.},

(2009) found that video feedback can help people undergoing cognitive therapy for SAD (CT-SAD) to develop a more realistic impression of how they appear to others, and this was associated with significant improvement in their social anxiety. In this paper we first present new data from 47 patients that confirms the value of video feedback. Ninety-eighty percent of the patients indicated that they came across more favorably than they had predicted after viewing a video of their social interactions. Significant reductions in social anxiety were observed during the following week and these reductions were larger than those observed after control periods. Comparison with our earlier data (McManus et al., 2009) suggests we may have improved the effectiveness of video feedback by refining and developing our procedures over time. The second part of the paper outlines our current strategies for maximizing the impact of video feedback. The strategies have evolved in order to help patients with SAD overcome a range of processing biases that could otherwise make it difficult for them to spot discrepancies between their negative self-imagery and the way they appear on video.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Suicidal behaviours in adolescents are a major public health problem and evidence-based prevention programmes are greatly needed. We aimed to investigate the efficacy of school-based preventive interventions of suicidal behaviours. METHODS: The Saving and Empowering Young Lives in Europe (SEYLE) study is a multicentre, cluster-randomised controlled trial. The SEYLE sample consisted of 11,110 adolescent pupils, median age 15 years (IQR 14-15), recruited from 168 schools in ten European Union countries. We randomly assigned the schools to one of three interventions or a control group. The interventions were: (1) Question, Persuade, and Refer (QPR), a gatekeeper training module targeting teachers and other school personnel, (2) the Youth Aware of Mental Health Programme (YAM) targeting pupils, and (3) screening by professionals (ProfScreen) with referral of at-risk pupils. Each school was randomly assigned by random number generator to participate in one intervention (or control) group only and was unaware of the interventions undertaken in the other three trial groups. The primary outcome measure was the number of suicide attempt(s) made by 3 month and 12 month follow-up. Analysis included all pupils with data available at each timepoint, excluding those who had ever attempted suicide or who had shown severe suicidal ideation during the 2 weeks before baseline. This study is registered with the German Clinical Trials Registry, number DRKS00000214. FINDINGS: Between Nov 1, 2009, and Dec 14, 2010, 168 schools (11,110 pupils) were randomly assigned to interventions (40 schools [2692 pupils] to QPR, 45 [2721] YAM, 43 [2764] ProfScreen, and 40 [2933] control). No significant differences between intervention groups and the control group were recorded at the 3 month follow-up. At the 12 month follow-up, YAM was associated with a significant reduction of incident suicide attempts (odds ratios [OR] 0{$\cdot$}45, 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}24-0{$\cdot$}85; p=0{$\cdot$}014) and severe suicidal ideation (0{$\cdot$}50, 0{$\cdot$}27-0{$\cdot$}92; p=0{$\cdot$}025), compared with the control group. 14 pupils (0{$\cdot$}70\%) reported incident suicide attempts at the 12 month follow-up in the YAM versus 34 (1{$\cdot$}51\%) in the control group, and 15 pupils (0{$\cdot$}75\%) reported incident severe suicidal ideation in the YAM group versus 31 (1{$\cdot$}37\%) in the control group. No participants completed suicide during the study period. INTERPRETATION: YAM was effective in reducing the number of suicide attempts and severe suicidal ideation in school-based adolescents. These findings underline the benefit of this universal suicide preventive intervention in schools. FUNDING: Coordination Theme 1 (Health) of the European Union Seventh Framework Programme.},

The authors tested a contrasting account, the reduced concreteness hypothesis, which postulates that the abstract thinking typical of rumination impairs SPS. In 40 depressed patients and 40 never-depressed controls, SPS was assessed before and after versions of symptom-focused rumination known to differentially induce abstract versus concrete self-focus (E. Watkins \& J. D. Teasdale, 2001). As predicted by reduced concreteness theory, relative to abstract self-focus, concrete self-focus improved SPS in depressed patients, suggesting that the particular mode of symptom-focus, rather than symptom-focus per se, determines the effects of rumination on problem solving.

  abstract = {We review research showing that rumination has multiple negative consequences: (a) exacerbating psychopathology by magnifying and prolonging negative mood states, interfering with problem-solving and instrumental behaviour and reducing sensitivity to changing contingencies; (b) acting as a transdiagnostic mental health vulnerability impacting anxiety, depression, psychosis, insomnia, and impulsive behaviours; (c) interfering with therapy and limiting the efficacy of psychological interventions; (d) exacerbating and maintaining physiological stress responses. The mechanisms underlying rumination are examined, and a model (H-EX-A-GO-N - Habit development, EXecutive control, Abstract processing, GOal discrepancies, Negative bias) is proposed to account for the onset and maintenance of rumination. H-EX-A-GO-N outlines how rumination results from dwelling on problematic goals developing into a learnt habit that involves the tendency to process negative information in an abstract way, particularly in the context of poor executive control and negative information-processing biases. These proximal factors integrate experimental evidence to provide a partial answer to the critical question of what maintains rumination. They constitute a pathway by which more distal biological and environmental factors increase the likelihood of rumination developing. Treatments for rumination are reviewed, with preliminary trials suggesting that psychological interventions designed to specifically target these mechanisms may be effective at reducing rumination.},

Most self-report measures of anhedonia has been developed for use with adults and their suitability for adolescents is questionable. In this article, we describe the development and psychometric qualities of a new measure, the Anhedonia Scale for Adolescents (ASA), designed specifically for use with adolescents aged 11-18 years. Items were generated from in-depth qualitative interviews with depressed young people, and then reviewed by an independent group of young people and clinically qualified experts in adolescent mental health. After piloting the new scale (n = 66), we established the structural validity of the measure with two groups of young people using exploratory (n = 1057) and confirmatory (n = 1041) factor analysis. The final scale consisted of 14 items, with 1 general factor and 3 specific factors producing the best fit to the data, (1) Enjoyment, Excitement, and Emotional Flattening (negatively framed); (2) Enthusiasm, Connection, and Purpose (positively framed); and (3) Effort, Motivation, and Drive (negatively framed). The ASA had high test-retest reliability and converged with standardized measures of depression, negative symptoms of schizophrenia, pleasure, and positive affect. Findings from these analyses provided evidence of incremental validity, as the ASA was a stronger predictor of clinical group (high vs. low depressive symptoms) than existing measures used to assess anhedonia. The ASA has potential as a new clinical and research tool to assess adolescent anhedonia. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved).},

Since the last broad-based youth meta-analysis in 1995, the number of trials has almost tripled and data-analytic methods have been refined. We applied these methods to the expanded study pool (447 studies; 30,431 youths), synthesizing 50 years of findings and identifying implications for research and practice. We assessed overall effect size (ES) and moderator effects using multilevel modeling to address ES dependency that is common, but typically not modeled, in meta-analyses. Mean posttreatment ES was 0.46; the probability that a youth in the treatment condition would fare better than a youth in the control condition was 63\%. Effects varied according to multiple moderators, including the problem targeted in treatment: Mean ES at posttreatment was strongest for anxiety (0.61), weakest for depression (0.29), and nonsignificant for multiproblem treatment (0.15). ESs differed across control conditions, with "usual care" emerging as a potent comparison condition, and across informants, highlighting the need to obtain and integrate multiple perspectives on outcome. Effects of therapy type varied by informant; only youth-focused behavioral therapies (including cognitive-behavioral therapy) showed similar and robust effects across youth, parent, and teacher reports. Effects did not differ for Caucasian versus minority samples, but more diverse samples are needed. The findings underscore the benefits of psychological treatments as well as the need for improved therapies and more representative, informative, and rigorous intervention science.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To complement standardized measurement of symptoms, we developed and tested an efficient strategy for identifying (before treatment) and repeatedly assessing (during treatment) the problems identified as most important by caregivers and youths in psychotherapy. METHOD: A total of 178 outpatient-referred youths, 7-13 years of age, and their caregivers separately identified the 3 problems of greatest concern to them at pretreatment and then rated the severity of those problems weekly during treatment. The Top Problems measure thus formed was evaluated for (a) whether it added to the information obtained through empirically derived standardized measures (e.g., the Child Behavior Checklist [CBCL; Achenbach \& Rescorla, 2001] and the Youth Self-Report [YSR; Achenbach \& Rescorla, 2001]) and (b) whether it met conventional psychometric standards. RESULTS: The problems identified were significant and clinically relevant; most matched CBCL/YSR items while adding specificity. The top problems also complemented the information yield of the CBCL/YSR; for example, for 41\% of caregivers and 79\% of youths, the identified top problems did not correspond to any items of any narrowband scales in the clinical range. Evidence on test-retest reliability, convergent and discriminant validity, sensitivity to change, slope reliability, and the association of Top Problems slopes with standardized measure slopes supported the psychometric strength of the measure. CONCLUSIONS: The Top Problems measure appears to be a psychometrically sound, client-guided approach that complements empirically derived standardized assessment; the approach can help focus attention and treatment planning on the problems that youths and caregivers consider most important and can generate evidence on trajectories of change in those problems during treatment.},

It was hypothesised that information concerning an increase in pulse rate would lead to increments in anxiety, negative beliefs and self-processing whilst information concerning a decrease in pulse rate would have the opposite effect. The results of this study were generally consistent with the hypotheses. These findings are important as they may help to account for fluctuations in anxiety, negative beliefs and self-processing in social situations that do not present objective social threat. In particular, social anxiety appears to be modulated by body-state information. The implications of the present findings for cognitive therapy of social phobia are briefly discussed.},

  abstract = {Motivational impairments are common in depression and have been linked to deficits in reward processing. Whitton et al. report that markers of reward-related ventrostriatal dopamine function may be useful for identifying depressed individuals likely to respond favourably to a dopaminergic antidepressant., The efficacy of dopamine agonists in treating major depressive disorder has been hypothesized to stem from effects on ventrostriatal dopamine and reward function. However, an important question is whether dopamine agonists are most beneficial for patients with reward-based deficits. This study evaluated whether measures of reward processing and ventrostriatal dopamine function predicted response to the dopamine agonist, pramipexole (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02033369). Individuals with major depressive disorder (n\,=\,26) and healthy controls (n\,=\,26) (mean {\textpm} SD age = 26.5\,{\textpm}\,5.9; 50\% female) first underwent assessments of reward learning behaviour and ventrostriatal prediction error signalling (measured using functional MRI). 11C-(+)-PHNO PET before and after oral amphetamine was used to assess ventrostriatal dopamine release. The depressed group then received open-label pramipexole treatment for 6 weeks (0.5 mg/day titrated to a maximum daily dose of 2.5 mg). Symptoms were assessed weekly, and reward learning was reassessed post-treatment. At baseline, relative to controls, the depressed group showed lower reward learning (P\,=\,0.02), a trend towards blunted reward-related prediction error signals (P\,=\,0.07), and a trend towards increased amphetamine-induced dopamine release (P\,=\,0.07). Despite symptom improvements following pramipexole (Cohen's d ranging from 0.51 to 2.16 across symptom subscales), reward learning did not change after treatment. At a group level, baseline reward learning (P\,=\,0.001) and prediction error signalling (P\,=\,0.004) were both associated with symptom improvement, albeit in a direction opposite to initial predictions: patients with stronger pretreatment reward learning and reward-related prediction error signalling improved most. Baseline D2/3 receptor availability (P\,=\,0.02) and dopamine release (P\,=\,0.05) also predicted improvements in clinical functioning, with lower D2/3 receptor availability and lower dopamine release predicting greater improvements. Although these findings await replication, they suggest that measures of reward-related mesolimbic dopamine function may hold promise for identifying depressed individuals likely to respond favourably to dopaminergic pharmacotherapy.},

By fitting models to experimental data we can probe the algorithms underlying behavior, find neural correlates of computational variables and better understand the effects of drugs, illness and interventions. But with great power comes great responsibility. Here, we offer ten simple rules to ensure that computational modeling is used with care and yields meaningful insights. In particular, we present a beginner-friendly, pragmatic and details-oriented introduction on how to relate models to data. What, exactly, can a model tell us about the mind? To answer this, we apply our rules to the simplest modeling techniques most accessible to beginning modelers and illustrate them with examples and code available online. However, most rules apply to more advanced techniques. Our hope is that by following our guidelines, researchers will avoid many pitfalls and unleash the power of computational modeling on their own data.},

Plomin, best known for his work in twin studies and behavior genetics, presents the attitude of environmentalist researchers to behavioral genetics and analyzes the myth of early childhood determinism. The interlocutors discuss clinical psychology, psychotherapy and the legitimacy of DSM diagnostic categories in the light of genetic research results. They discuss the persistent resistance of psychologists to these discoveries in the terms of Thomas Kuhn's paradigmatic wars. Plomin also presents his view on the causes of and the ways of overcoming the crisis in psychology, mentioning specifically the case of Cyril Burt, the misuse of epigenetics and the validity of gender studies' claims. The analysis of the achievements of psychology, the questions it faces and an overview of Plomin's current research conclude this chapter.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Aberrations in reward and penalty processing are implicated in depression and putatively reflect altered dopamine signalling. This study exploits the advantages of a placebo-controlled design to examine how a novel D2 antagonist with adjunctive antidepressant properties modifies activity in the brain's reward network in depression. METHODS: We recruited 43 medication-na{\"i}ve subjects across the range of depression severity (Beck's Depression Inventory-II score range: 0-43), including healthy volunteers, as well as people meeting full-criteria for major depressive disorder. In a double-blind placebo-controlled cross-over design, all subjects received either placebo or lurasidone (20 mg) across two visits separated by 1 week. Functional magnetic resonance imaging with the Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) task assessed reward functions via neural responses during anticipation and receipt of gains and losses. Arterial spin labelling measured cerebral blood flow (CBF) at rest. RESULTS: Lurasidone altered fronto-striatal activity during anticipation and outcome phases of the MID task. A significant three-way Medication-by-Depression severity-by-Outcome interaction emerged in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) after correction for multiple comparisons. Follow-up analyses revealed significantly higher ACC activation to losses in high- v. low depression participants in the placebo condition, with a normalisation by lurasidone. This effect could not be accounted for by shifts in resting CBF. CONCLUSIONS: Lurasidone acutely normalises reward processing signals in individuals with depressive symptoms. Lurasidone's antidepressant effects may arise from reducing responses to penalty outcomes in individuals with depressive symptoms.},

Two experiments examined the hypothesis that affect itself induces self-focused attention. In Experiment 1, moods were manipulated with an imagination mood-induction procedure. Sad-induction Ss became higher in self-focus than did neutral-induction Ss. Experiment 2 replicated this effect for sad moods by means of a musical mood-induction procedure and different measures of self-focus. However, Experiment 2 failed to support the hypothesis that happy moods induce self-focus. The results have implications for mood-induction research, self-focused attention, and recent models of depression.},

The authors tested this hypothesis in a longitudinal study of adolescent girls involving 4 waves of data collected over approximately 19 months. The authors expected that high baseline levels of depressive symptoms would facilitate the development of adolescents' goal adjustment capacities (i.e., goal disengagement capacities and goal reengagement capacities). In addition, the authors expected that improvements in goal adjustment capacities over time would presage lower levels of subsequent depressive symptoms. Data from the first 3 waves produced results demonstrating that baseline levels of depressive symptoms predicted an increase in goal disengagement capacities over time but not in goal reengagement capacities. Moreover, increases in goal disengagement capacities predicted a reduction in subsequent depressive symptoms. The findings suggest that depressive symptomatology may serve adaptive functions by facilitating the development of goal disengagement capacities in adolescence.},

	abstract = {Background: European and US pharmaceutical agencies have recently warned against the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in child and adolescent depression. This came as a surprise to many practitioners, who had made treatment decisions based on data from pharmaceutical trials using adult samples. Method: The author reviews the recent literature relevant to the use of SSRIs in youth depression, including psychiatricclinical trials, pharmacology and drug safety data. Recommendations and rationales for the use of SSRIs in this context are offered. Results: Ten publications, comprising a total of 2,046 patients, evaluated the efficacy of four SSRIs (fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline and citalopram) in child and adolescent depression. It is noted that an additional 6 trials (with a total of 1,234 patients) were not reported by the industry because of a lack of efficacy or problematic side effects, including suicidal behaviors. Meta-analyses revealed no data supporting the use of SSRIs, except for fluoxetine. To formulate recommendations for clinical practice, it is necessary to examine specific issues such as (1) the link between SSRIs, depression and suicidal risk; (2) SSRI age-related specific effects, and (3) the high placebo response in child and adolescent depression. Conclusion: An SSRI prescription is still a second-line option in severe and resistant forms of youth depression. However, in children and adolescents only specialists well trained in child and adolescent psychiatry should prescribe SSRIs.},
